- Verify Wirepas gateway is installed and connected (LED blinking green) Identify the sensor - Scan QR code with Thingsee Toolbox app or QR reader Plan sensor placement - Review detection area charts for your installation height Select appropriate dome - Choose Visitor Counter or Occupancy dome if needed Installation Steps 1. Remove Battery Tab Carefully pull out the battery security tab LED indicator (red) will flash once If no LED flash within 2 minutes, tap sensor against palm If no events within 5 minutes, re-install batteries 2. Clean Surface Clean attachment surface with IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol) Ensure surface is dry before mounting 3. Attach Sensor Remove tape’s paper cover from sensor backside Push sensor firmly against surface for minimum 5 seconds Wipe sensor with dry, clean cloth Detection Capability Height-Dependent Detection Area Thingsee PRESENCE detection capability changes based on installation height. The chart below shows different detection zones at various heights.\nKey Points:\nDetection area is cone-shaped Wider coverage at greater distances Adjusted sensitivity levels (white lines) shown for illustration Detection area changes with sensor sensitivity level Maximum 34 movements detected per minute regardless of direction or distance Visitor Counting Installation Ceiling Installation Place sensor in middle of door opening Position 5-10 cm from wall Ensure no obstacles between sensor and detection area Recommended height: 2.4-2.7m Door Opening Installation Install at top middle of door opening Orient sensor according to movement direction Ensure clear line of sight to floor Avoid direct sunlight exposure Using Visitor Counter Dome The Visitor Counter Dome narrows the detection beam for improved counting accuracy:\nDome narrows detection beam for accuracy Detection area is narrowed relative to sensor’s long side Can be attached with screws for secure installation Attachment clips alone sufficient for most installations Installation Tips:\nAlign dome properly before snapping on Ensure dome is fully seated Use screws for permanent installations Clips work well for temporary or testing setups Workspace Occupancy Installation Under-Table Installation Install sensor under table as centered as possible If table legs present, place sensor on user side of leg Maintain 50mm gap between sensor and objects for maintenance access Decrease sensitivity to avoid detections outside workspace Recommended height: 60-70cm from floor Using Occupancy Dome The Occupancy Dome adjusts the detection beam for under-desk use:\nDome adjusts detection beam for under-desk use Orient dome hole facing front for best accuracy Can be attached with screws if needed Cut off screw attachment parts if using clips only (do not damage clips) Installation Tips:\nTest detection area after installation Adjust sensitivity to focus on workspace only Verify no false triggers from nearby walkways Consider desk height and user seating position Installation Guidelines PIR Technology Considerations Detection Principle:\nDetects changes in heat sources (moving humans) Temperature difference between person and environment affects reliability Small temperature differences reduce reliability significantly Optimal Conditions:\nEnvironment temperature: 15-25°C Person temperature: 36-37°C Good thermal contrast required Factors Affecting Accuracy Visitor Counting Accuracy Factors:\nWidth of doorway (wider = more simultaneous passages) People walking side-by-side Standing or slowly moving lines Cleaning and maintenance activities Very slow-moving individuals Environmental Factors:\nDirect sunlight creates thermal variations Heat sources (radiators, HVAC vents) cause false triggers Rapid ambient temperature changes reduce sensitivity Installation height affects detection area size Things to Avoid ❌ Avoid Installation too high - Excessively large detection area Direct sunlight exposure - Thermal variations reduce accuracy Near heat sources - Radiators, HVAC vents cause false triggers High temperature variation areas - Reduces sensor reliability Frequent thermal disturbances - Unstable detection Too close to traffic flow - People passing very near sensor Wide open areas - Unpredictable movement patterns ✅ Optimal Conditions Controlled temperature environment - Stable ambient temperature Clear detection zone - No obstructions Predictable traffic patterns - Consistent movement flows Appropriate installation height - Matched to use case Good thermal contrast - Clear difference between people and environment Protected from sunlight - No direct sun exposure Away from heat sources - No radiators or vents nearby Installation Scenarios Doorway Visitor Counting Setup:\nUse Visitor Counter Dome Mount at ceiling above doorway center Height: 2.4-2.7m Position: 5-10cm from wall Configuration:\nThreshold: 150 (default sensitivity) Mode: 0 (Movement count reporting) Report interval: 60 seconds Expected Accuracy: ~85-95% in single-file traffic\nUnder-Desk Workspace Occupancy Setup:\nUse Occupancy Dome Mount under desk center Height: 60-70cm from floor Clearance: 50mm from table legs Configuration:\nThreshold: 800 (reduced sensitivity) Mode: 1 (Occupancy reporting) Report interval: 300 seconds Expected Accuracy: ~95% for typical desk usage\nMeeting Room Occupancy Setup:\nNo dome required (standard detection) Mount on ceiling or wall Height: 2.4-3.0m Position: Central location with clear view Configuration:\nThreshold: 150 (default sensitivity) Mode: 1 (Occupancy reporting) Report interval: 300 seconds Expected Accuracy: ~90% for typical meeting usage\nHigh-Traffic Corridor Monitoring Setup:\nConsider Visitor Counter Dome for focus Mount on ceiling Height: 2.5-3.0m Position: Center of corridor width Configuration:\nThreshold: 100 (increased sensitivity) Mode: 2 (Event-based movement count) Report interval: 120 seconds Passive interval: 7200 seconds Accuracy: Variable based on corridor width and traffic density\nInstallation Verification Testing Procedure Enable LED - Configure LED indication for visual feedback Set short intervals - Use 10-second report interval for testing Walk through detection area - Test coverage systematically Observe LED flashes - Verify detection on movement Review cloud data - Check messages arriving correctly Adjust if needed - Reposition or adjust sensitivity Set production config - Disable LED, set normal intervals Verification Checklist LED flashes on battery installation Sensor reporting to cloud within 5 minutes Movement detected consistently in target area No false triggers from adjacent areas Detection area matches expectations Gateway showing strong signal (RSSI \u003e -70 dBm) Configuration applied successfully Installation Accessories Visitor Counter Dome Purpose: Doorways and corridors visitor counting\nFeatures:\nPhysically narrows detection beam Creates more accurate counting zone Reduces false triggers from adjacent areas Most effective for doorway widths 0.8-1.2m Installation:\nSnap onto sensor (clips) Optional screw attachment for permanent installations Orient according to traffic direction Occupancy Dome Purpose: Under-desk workspace occupancy detection\nFeatures:\nReduces detection area for focused monitoring Prevents triggers from nearby walkways Essential for under-desk installations Allows lower sensitivity settings Installation:\nSnap onto sensor (clips) Orient hole facing front Optional screw attachment Can cut off screw parts if using clips only Mounting Considerations Adhesive Tape:\nIncluded with sensor Sufficient for most installations Clean surface with IPA before application Press firmly for 5+ seconds Screw Mounting (Domes):\nUse correct screw type for surface Don’t over-tighten (risk damaging dome) Provides more secure attachment Recommended for high-ceiling installations Post-Installation Initial Monitoring Monitor sensor performance for 24-48 hours after installation:\nCheck message frequency - Verify expected reporting intervals Review detection counts - Validate accuracy against known traffic Monitor battery level - Ensure normal power consumption Verify network connectivity - Check RSSI and hop count Adjust if needed - Fine-tune sensitivity or position Documentation Record installation details:\nInstallation date and technician Sensor serial number and location Configuration settings applied Dome type (if used) Expected traffic patterns Any special considerations Related Documentation Operation Guide -

Add decompression before CBOR decoding:\nPython with zlib:\nimport zlib import cbor2 def decode_compressed_cbor(binary_payload): try: # Decompress with zlib decompressed = zlib.decompress(binary_payload) # Decode CBOR cbor_data = cbor2.loads(decompressed) # Process as normal... return cbor_data except zlib.error: # Not compressed, decode directly return cbor2.loads(binary_payload) JavaScript with pako:\nconst pako = require('pako');

return cborData; } catch (error) { // Not compressed, decode directly return cbor.decodeFirstSync(binaryPayload); } } Best Practices Decoder Implementation Use established CBOR libraries - Don’t implement CBOR parser from scratch\nPython: cbor2 JavaScript: cbor Java: com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-cbor C#: PeterO.Cbor Handle unknown indexes gracefully - New firmware may introduce fields not in your mapping table\nprop_name = CBOR_INDEX_MAP.get(cbor_index, f\"unknown_{cbor_index}\") Validate message structure - Check for required fields before processing\nif \"tsmId\" not in message or \"tsmEv\" not in message: logger.warning(\"Invalid message structure\") return None Log unknown indexes - Track unmapped indexes to update decoder\nif cbor_index not in CBOR_INDEX_MAP: logger.info(f\"Unknown CBOR index {cbor_index} with value {value}\") Timestamp Handling Sensor messages don’t include timestamps - Gateway must add from Wirepas time-in-transit Use UTC timestamps - All tsmTs values are UTC epoch seconds Precision - Can use decimals for millisecond resolution (e.g., 1492844596.123) Network disconnected events (tsmEv: 18) - May lack tsmTs, cloud should generate Device Identification Wirepas node ID - Primary identifier in raw CBOR messages Serial number lookup - Map node ID to serial via device database/API Use Service API - Query for complete device details including serial, name, model query DeviceByWirepasNode($nodeId: Int!) { devices(where: {identifiers: {wirepasNodeId: {_eq: $nodeId}}}) { id name identifiers { wirepasNodeId vendorSerial } deviceType { productName } } } Error Handling Invalid CBOR - Malformed binary should be logged and discarded Missing required fields - Validate tsmId and tsmEv presence Out-of-range values - Check multiplier results are reasonable Compression errors - Try non-compressed decode if decompression fails Performance Optimization Batch processing - Process messages in batches rather than one-by-one Cache mappings - Load CBOR index map once, reuse for all messages Parallel decoding - Use worker threads for high-volume deployments Database writes - Batch inserts for better throughput Message ID Ranges Message IDs (tsmId) identify the device type and message structure:\nProfile ID Range Description Example Devices 1000-1999 Common profile System messages 12000-12999 Environment monitoring Thingsee ENVIRONMENT 13000-13999 Presence and occupancy Thingsee PRESENCE 14000-14999 Distance measurement Thingsee COUNT, Thingsee BEAM 28000-28999 Radar-based sensors Thingsee RADAR Refer to device-specific documentation for complete message ID lists and field definitions.\nTroubleshooting No Messages Received Check:\nMQTT subscription includes correct Wirepas endpoint (21/21 for Thingsee CBOR) Gateway is connected and forwarding messages Sensors are configured with correct network ID and encryption keys Default report interval is often 1 hour - wait or configure shorter interval CBOR Decoding Errors Check:\nBinary payload is complete (not truncated) Using correct CBOR library version Message might be compressed - try zlib decompression first Endpoint 238/238 uses TLV, not CBOR Incorrect Values After Conversion Check:\nMultiplier applied correctly (divide by 10^x, not multiply) CBOR index mapping matches device firmware version Device-specific indexes (\u003e1000) documented in device manual Negative values handled correctly (temperature, acceleration) Missing Timestamp Check:\nGateway adding tsmTs from Wirepas time-in-transit Network disconnected events (tsmEv: 18) may require cloud-generated timestamp Clock synchronization on gateway Unknown CBOR Indexes Check:\nDevice firmware version - new firmware may add fields Device-specific documentation for custom indexes Log unknown indexes to identify patterns Update decoder mapping table Related Documentation Thingsee PRESENCE - Presence sensor message details Binary Passthrough API - Direct CBOR message access Service API (GraphQL) - Device identity lookup Message Profiles - Profile-specific message definitions ","categories":"","description":"Complete guide for converting Thingsee CBOR binary messages to JSON format\n","excerpt":"Complete guide for converting Thingsee CBOR binary messages to JSON …","ref":"/devices/technical-reference/cbor-json-conversion/","tags":"","title":"Thingsee CBOR to JSON Conversion"},{"body":"Overview Thingsee IoT is Haltian’s established IoT platform providing secure, scalable device connectivity and data services for enterprise deployments.\nPlatform Highlights Wirepas Mesh Networking - Self-healing, scalable wireless mesh for large deployments Open Service API - RESTful API for device management and data access Message Profiles - Standardized data formats for sensors and gateways Enterprise Integrations - Azure IoT Hub, AWS, MQTT streams, and more Documentation Sections Getting Started Platform overview, architecture, and quick start guide.

movement count at intervals using message 13100 1 Occupancy reporting Reports occupancy state changes using message 2100 2 Event-based movement count Reports movement count only when detected, otherwise uses passive interval Mode 0: Movement Count Reporting (Default)\nBehavior:\nReports movement count periodically using message 13100 Uses reportInterval from message 1500 configuration Reports regardless of whether movement detected Counter increments during measurement interval Counter resets after each report Message Flow:\nInterval starts (e.g., 60 seconds) PIR detects movements, increments counter At interval end, sends message 13100 with moveCount Counter resets to 0 Next interval begins Typical Settings:\n{ \"mode\": 0 } Combined with message 1500:\n{ \"tsmId\": 1500, \"measurementInterval\": 60, \"reportInterval\": 60 } Use Cases:\nVisitor counting Traffic analysis Doorway monitoring Area popularity tracking Trend analysis Network Traffic: Moderate (reports every interval regardless of activity)\nMode 1: Occupancy Reporting\nBehavior:\nReports occupancy state changes using message 2100 Sends message only when state changes (occupied ↔ vacant) Reports every passiveReportInterval regardless of state Reduces network traffic significantly Lower power consumption Message Flow:\nPIR detects movement → state = occupied Sends message 2100 with state = 1 (occupied) No movement for threshold period → state = vacant Sends message 2100 with state = 0 (vacant) If no state change for passiveReportInterval, sends periodic update Typical Settings:\n{ \"mode\": 1, \"passiveReportInterval\": 3600 } Use Cases:\nWorkspace occupancy monitoring Meeting room status Desk utilization tracking Hot-desking management Binary occupancy status Network Traffic: Low (only on state changes + periodic updates)\nMode 2: Event-Based Movement Count Reporting\nBehavior:\nReports movement count using message 13100 Uses reportInterval when movement detected Uses passiveReportInterval when no movement Balances detail with efficiency Message Flow:\nWith movement:\nInterval starts (reportInterval) PIR detects movements At reportInterval, sends message 13100 Continues using reportInterval while movement detected Without movement:\nNo movement detected Uses passiveReportInterval instead At passiveReportInterval, sends message 13100 with moveCount=0 Returns to reportInterval if movement resumes Typical Settings:\n{ \"mode\": 2, \"passiveReportInterval\": 3600 } Combined with message 1500:\n{ \"tsmId\": 1500, \"measurementInterval\": 60,

Variable (low during idle, moderate during activity)\npassiveReportInterval Type: Integer\nRange: 0 to 86400\nDefault: 3600\nUnit: Seconds\nPurpose: Configure reporting interval when no movement detected (modes 1 and 2 only)\nDescription: When in mode 1 (Occupancy) or mode 2 (Event-based movement count), this parameter defines how often the sensor sends reports when no activity is detected.\nValid Only For:\nMode 1 (Occupancy reporting) Mode 2 (Event-based movement count) Ignored For:\nMode 0 (Movement count reporting) - uses reportInterval from message 1500 instead Requirements:\nMust be longer than reportInterval (configured in message 1500) Common values: 3600 (1 hour), 7200 (2 hours), 21600 (6 hours) Example:\n{ \"mode\": 2, \"passiveReportInterval\": 3600 } Use Cases:\nInterval Use Case 1800 (30 min) Frequently monitored areas, quick status updates 3600 (1 hour) Standard monitoring (default) 7200 (2 hours) Low-priority areas, battery conservation 21600 (6 hours) Rarely used spaces, maximum battery life 86400 (24 hours) Infrequently monitored, emergency backup reporting Interaction with reportInterval:\nActive reporting (reportInterval from message 1500):\nUsed when movement is detected (mode 2) Used for state changes (mode 1) Typically 60-300 seconds Passive reporting (passiveReportInterval):\nUsed when no movement detected (mode 2) Used for periodic updates (mode 1) Typically 3600+ seconds Battery Impact:\nLonger intervals = extended battery life 3600s (1 hour): Standard battery life 7200s (2 hours): ~10% battery life increase 21600s (6 hours): ~20% battery life increase Best Practice: Set passiveReportInterval to at least 10x reportInterval to balance monitoring needs with battery conservation.\nMessage 13210 - Occupancy Light

Essential for tracking configuration status Query before changing - Send empty config to see current values Change one parameter at a time - Easier to troubleshoot issues Monitor for 24 hours - Verify configuration effectiveness over full day Document configurations - Maintain record of settings per sensor Test during peak hours - Validate during typical usage patterns Sensitivity Tuning Step-by-step process:\nStart with default (150)\nDeploy sensor with standard settings Monitor for 24 hours Identify issues\nToo many false triggers → increase threshold Missing detections → decrease threshold Adjust incrementally\nChange by 50-100 units at a time Test for several hours between changes Consider environment\nHigh ambient temperature → may need lower threshold Thermal variations → may need higher threshold Under-desk → start with 800 Seasonal adjustment\nSummer (warmer): May need lower threshold Winter (cooler): May need higher threshold Consider quarterly reviews Mode Selection Choose based on use case:\nUse Case Recommended Mode Reason Visitor counting Mode 0 Need actual count values Desk occupancy Mode 1 Binary status sufficient, low traffic Meeting room Mode 1 State changes more relevant than counts High-traffic corridor Mode 2 Balance detail with battery life Rarely used area Mode 2 Minimal reporting when idle Energy critical Mode 1 Lowest network traffic Interval Configuration Balancing factors:\nData freshness - How quickly you need updates Battery life - Longer intervals = longer battery Network load - Shorter intervals = more Wirepas traffic Cloud costs - More messages = higher processing costs Use case criticality - Critical areas need frequent updates Common patterns:\nPattern measurementInterval reportInterval passiveReportInterval Use Case Standard 60s 60s 3600s General monitoring Detailed 30s 30s 1800s High-priority areas Conservative 300s 300s 7200s Battery-critical deployments Testing 10s 10s 3600s Installation validation Network Considerations Wirepas mesh network capacity:\nEach sensor transmission uses network bandwidth Dense deployments need longer intervals Consider total messages per gateway Typical limit: ~100 sensors per gateway at 60s intervals Optimization strategies:\nUse mode 1 (Occupancy) for most sensors Use mode 2 (Event-based) for variable-traffic areas Set passiveReportInterval to 3600s or higher Stagger reportInterval across sensors (avoid synchronized bursts) Battery Life Optimization Factors affecting battery life:\nReport interval (most significant) Movement frequency (more detections = more transmissions) Network hops (distance to gateway) LED usage (minimal impact) Configuration changes (avoid frequent updates) To maximize battery life:\nUse mode 1 or 2 instead of mode 0 Increase passiveReportInterval to 7200s or higher Disable LED (enableLed: 0) Optimize gateway placement to reduce hops Use event-based reporting where possible Expected battery life:\nConfiguration Expected Life Mode 0, 60s intervals, LED off 2-3 years Mode 1, 3600s passive, LED off 3-4 years Mode 2, 7200s passive, LED off 4+ years Any mode, LED on -5 to -10% Troubleshooting Configuration Configuration Not Applied Symptoms:\nSensor response shows old values Behavior doesn’t change No response to configuration message Possible Causes:\nSensor not joined to network Incorrect Wirepas endpoints (must be 21/21) CBOR encoding error Invalid parameter values Network congestion Solutions:\nVerify sensor is reporting to cloud Check Wirepas endpoints in configuration tool Validate CBOR encoding with test decoder Review parameter ranges in this document Retry during low-traffic period Increase configuration timeout to 60 seconds Sensor Not Responding to Query Symptoms:\nNo response to empty configuration message TransactionId not returned Possible Causes:\nSensor in sleep mode Batteries depleted Network disconnection Wrong device serial number Solutions:\nWait for next scheduled report Check battery level alerts Verify gateway operational Confirm correct tsmTuid in request Trigger movement to wake sensor Allow up to 5 minutes for response Parameter Value Clamped Symptoms:\nResponse shows different value than request Threshold 50 requested, 60 returned Cause: Value outside valid range, sensor clamped to nearest valid value\nSolution: This is expected behavior.

Each mode has different reporting behavior, network traffic characteristics, and optimal use cases.\nImportant Data Latency: There’s always a delay from measurement to alerts. Measurement results are sent in predefined intervals (e.g., 1 minute) and time is needed for data to travel through the network and be processed in the cloud service. This sensor is not suitable for real-time applications requiring instant alerts.\nOperating Modes Mode 0: Movement Count Reporting (Default) Purpose: Reports indicative count of detected movements for traffic analysis\nCharacteristics:\nMeasurement type - Movement detection count Active reporting - Every 1 minute when movement observed (configurable) Idle reporting - Every 1 hour if no movement detected (configurable) Maximum count - 34 events per minute Use cases - Doorways, corridors, entrances, visitor counting Message Flow:\nInterval starts (e.g., 60 seconds) ↓ PIR detects movements → counter increments ↓ At interval end → sends message 13100 with moveCount ↓ Counter resets to 0 ↓ Next interval begins Typical Configuration:\n{ \"mode\": 0, \"threshold\": 150 } Combined with system configuration:\n{ \"tsmId\": 1500, \"measurementInterval\": 60, \"reportInterval\": 60 } Network Traffic: Moderate (reports every interval regardless of activity)\nAccuracy Considerations:\nPeople walking side-by-side may count as single detection Very slow movement may not trigger detection Multiple people in close proximity may undercount Best for general traffic trends, not exact counts Mode 1: Occupancy Reporting Purpose: Reports workspace or area occupancy status using event-based messaging\nCharacteristics:\nMeasurement type - Occupancy status (occupied/vacant) Event reporting - Only when status changes (occupied ↔ vacant) Idle reporting - Every 1 hour if no status change (configurable) Network efficiency - Reduces Wirepas traffic significantly Use cases - Desk occupancy, meeting rooms, individual spaces Message Flow:\nPIR detects movement → state = occupied ↓ Sends message 2100 with state = 1 (occupied) ↓ No movement for threshold period → state = vacant ↓ Sends message 2100 with state = 0 (vacant) ↓ If no state change for passiveReportInterval → periodic update Typical Configuration:\n{ \"mode\": 1, \"threshold\": 150, \"passiveReportInterval\": 3600 } Network Traffic: Low (only on state changes + periodic updates)\nAdvantages:\nLower network traffic (only on state changes) Reduced power consumption Clear binary status (occupied/vacant) Suitable for workspace management systems Longer battery life Mode 2: Event-Based Movement Count Reporting Purpose: Balances detailed movement counting with battery conservation\nCharacteristics:\nMeasurement type - Movement detection count Active reporting - Uses reportInterval when movement detected Idle reporting - Uses passiveReportInterval when no movement Efficiency - Reduces reporting during idle periods Use cases - Variable traffic areas, battery conservation priority Message Flow:\nWith movement:\nInterval starts (reportInterval) ↓ PIR detects movements ↓ At reportInterval → sends message 13100 ↓ Continues using reportInterval while movement detected Without movement:\nNo movement detected ↓ Uses passiveReportInterval instead ↓ At passiveReportInterval → sends message 13100 with moveCount=0 ↓ Returns to reportInterval if movement resumes Typical Configuration:\n{ \"mode\": 2, \"threshold\": 150, \"passiveReportInterval\": 3600 } Combined with system configuration:\n{ \"tsmId\": 1500, \"measurementInterval\": 60, \"reportInterval\": 60 } Network Traffic: Variable (low during idle, moderate during activity)\nUse Cases:\nAreas with intermittent activity Energy-efficient monitoring Battery conservation priority Reducing cloud data volume Messages Message 13100 -

completely passive monitoring Privacy-friendly - no cameras or identifying data Temperature Dependency:\nRequires thermal contrast between person and environment Best performance: environment 15-25°C, person 36-37°C Reduced performance when ambient temperature approaches body temperature Small temperature differences significantly reduce reliability Movement Requirements:\nSensor detects movement, not static presence Slow-moving individuals may not trigger detection Stationary person will not be detected Best suited for normal walking speeds Detection Limitations Counting Accuracy:\nMultiple simultaneous passages - People walking side-by-side may count as one Slow movement - Very slow walkers may not trigger detection Dense crowds - Standing/slow-moving queues reduce accuracy Wide doorways - Accuracy decreases with doorway width (\u003e1.5m) Environmental Factors:\nDirect sunlight - Thermal variations reduce accuracy Heat sources - Radiators, HVAC vents cause false triggers Temperature changes - Rapid ambient changes reduce sensitivity Installation height - Too high creates excessively large detection area Maximum Detection Rate Limit: 34 movements per minute Behavior: If more than 34 movements occur, counter saturates at 34 Impact: Very high traffic may be undercounted Mitigation: Use multiple sensors for wide or high-traffic areas Configuration Impact on Operation Sensitivity (threshold parameter) Threshold Sensitivity Typical Use Case 60-100 Very high Large open areas, distant detection 150 Default Standard doorways, general use 200-400 Medium Medium-sized rooms 500-800 Low Under-desk occupancy 900-1100 Very low Small zones, reducing false triggers Effect on Operation:\nLower threshold = more sensitive = more detections = potential false positives Higher threshold = less sensitive = fewer detections = potential missed movements Report Intervals reportInterval (Mode 0 \u0026 2):\nHow often sensor sends messages when active Shorter = more frequent data, higher battery drain Longer = less frequent data, extended battery life Typical: 60-300 seconds passiveReportInterval (Mode 1 \u0026 2):\nHow often sensor sends messages when inactive Only used in modes 1 and 2 Much longer than reportInterval (typically 3600+ seconds) Provides periodic “heartbeat” even when no activity LED Indicator When Enabled:\nRed flash on movement detection Useful for installation verification Minimal battery impact (\u003c5%) Should be disabled for production When Disabled:\nNo visual feedback Standard production configuration Maximizes battery life Message Flow Examples Example 1: Doorway Counter (Mode 0) Configuration:\nMode: 0 reportInterval: 60s threshold: 150 Timeline:\n00:00 - Interval starts, counter = 0 00:15 - Person passes, counter = 1 00:30 - Person passes, counter = 2 00:45 - Person passes, counter = 3 01:00 - Interval ends, sends message: moveCount = 3, counter resets 01:00 - Next interval starts, counter = 0 01:30 - Person passes, counter = 1 02:00 - Interval ends, sends message: moveCount = 1, counter resets Example 2: Desk Occupancy (Mode 1) Configuration:\nMode: 1 passiveReportInterval: 3600s threshold: 800 Timeline:\n08:00 - Person sits down, movement detected 08:01 - State changes to \"occupied\", sends message: state = 1 08:05 - Small movements (typing, mouse) keep state occupied 12:00 - Person leaves for lunch 12:02 - No movement for threshold period 12:03 - State changes to \"vacant\", sends message: state = 0 13:00 - Person returns 13:01 - Movement detected, state changes to \"occupied\", sends message: state = 1 Example 3: Corridor Monitoring (Mode 2) Configuration:\nMode: 2 reportInterval: 120s (active) passiveReportInterval: 7200s (idle) threshold: 100 Timeline:\n08:00 - High traffic period begins 08:02 - Sends message: moveCount = 15 (using 120s interval) 08:04 - Sends message: moveCount = 12 (using 120s interval) ... 17:00 - Traffic decreases, last movement 17:02 - Sends message: moveCount = 3 (using 120s interval) 17:04 - No movement, switches to passive interval 19:04 - Sends message: moveCount = 0 (using 7200s interval - 2 hours later) Related Documentation Installation Guide -

This document covers only the cloud-based approach where data is routed through Haltian IoT Cloud.\nData Flow (Cloud-Based):\nSensor → Wirepas Gateway → Haltian IoT Cloud → MQTT Broker → Your Application MQTT Topic Structure Topic Pattern haltian-iot/events/{subscriptionId}/{keyId}/payloads/wirepas/+ Segment Description haltian-iot/events Fixed prefix for all Haltian IoT events {subscriptionId} Your GraphQL subscription UUID {keyId} MQTT authentication key identifier payloads/wirepas Indicates Wirepas mesh network data + Wildcard matching any device identifier Note: The device identifier is the Haltian IoT device UUID (e.g., 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000), not the Wirepas node address.\nExample Topic haltian-iot/events/abc123-def456/key789/payloads/wirepas/device-uuid-001 Subscription Pattern Subscribe to all devices under your subscription using:\ntopic = f\"haltian-iot/events/{subscription_id}/{key_id}/payloads/wirepas/+\" client.subscribe(topic) MQTT Payload Structure (JSON) The MQTT message payload is a JSON object containing metadata and the binary sensor data encoded as base64.\nJSON Schema { \"received_at\": \"2026-01-29T12:34:56.789Z\", \"value\": { \"mqtt_topic\": \"haltian-iot/wirepas/gw-event/received_data/BS225000789/sink1/7156763/21/21\", \"payload\": \"CkpCTgofCgtCUzIyNTAwMDc4ORIFc2luazEY65DNj9fX+JPTARj...\" } } Example breakdown (endpoint 21/21 - Thingsee CBOR):\nDevice: Thingsee sensor (node address 7156763) Gateway: BS225000789 / sink1 Inner payload (after protobuf decode): CBOR array containing temperature, humidity, battery level After full decoding, this example yields:\n{ \"tsmId\": 12345678, \"tsmEv\": 10, \"tsmTs\": 1706528096, \"temp\": 23.45, \"humd\": 45.2, \"batl\": 95 } Field Descriptions Field Type Description received_at string ISO 8601 timestamp when message was received by Haltian IoT Cloud value.mqtt_topic string Original Wirepas gateway MQTT topic (contains routing info) value.payload string Base64-encoded Wirepas protobuf message Origin Topic Structure The value.mqtt_topic field contains the original gateway topic with embedded endpoint information:\nhaltian-iot/wirepas/gw-event/received_data/{gateway}/{sink}/{node_address}/{source_ep}/{dest_ep} Segment Example Description {gateway} BS225000789 Wirepas gateway identifier {sink} sink1 Gateway sink name {node_address} 7156763 Wirepas node address (sensor) {source_ep} 11 Source endpoint (data type) {dest_ep} 11 Destination endpoint Extracting the Binary Payload import base64 import json def extract_payload(mqtt_message: bytes) -\u003e tuple[bytes, str, str]: \"\"\" Extract binary payload and endpoints from MQTT JSON message.

This is the standard Wirepas mesh network transport format.\nImportant: All devices in the Wirepas mesh use the same protobuf wrapper. The device-specific format (CBOR, binary, TLV) is contained within the payload_data field of the protobuf. The endpoint pair indicates which format to expect inside.\nProtobuf Schema (Simplified) message WirepasMessage { uint32 source_address = 1; // Sensor node address (unique per device) uint32 destination_address = 2; // Target address (usually gateway) uint32 source_endpoint = 3; // Identifies data type/protocol uint32 destination_endpoint = 4; // Usually matches source_endpoint uint64 travel_time_ms = 5; // Network transit time uint32 qos = 6; // Quality of service level bytes payload_data = 7; // The actual sensor data (inner payload) uint64 rx_time_ms_epoch = 8; // Receive timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) } Key Fields Explained Field Purpose Typical Values source_address Unique sensor identifier 32-bit integer (e.g., 12345678) source_endpoint Data protocol identifier 1, 11, 21, 120, 160 destination_endpoint Usually matches source Same as source_endpoint payload_data Inner binary payload Format depends on endpoint rx_time_ms_epoch Message receive time Unix timestamp in milliseconds Endpoint Routing The endpoint pair (source_endpoint/destination_endpoint) determines how to parse the inner payload_data. Each endpoint type uses a different encoding format.\nKnown Endpoint Types Source EP Dest EP Protocol Inner Format Description 21 21 Thingsee CBOR CBOR array Thingsee multi-sensor devices Decoding the Wirepas Protobuf Wrapper Python Implementation import struct from dataclasses import dataclass from typing import Optional @dataclass class WirepasMessage: source_address: int destination_address: int source_endpoint: int destination_endpoint: int travel_time_ms: int qos: int payload_data: bytes rx_time_ms_epoch: int def decode_wirepas_message(raw_data: bytes) -\u003e WirepasMessage: \"\"\" Decode Wirepas protobuf message.

observed traffic Consistent undercounting or overcounting Erratic count values Possible Causes:\nInstallation height too high People walking side-by-side Doorway too wide Temperature contrast insufficient Nearby heat sources Sensitivity incorrectly configured Detection area too large or too small Solutions:\nVerify installation height\nRecommended: 2.4-2.7m for doorways Too high = larger detection area = less accurate Lower installation for better accuracy Use Visitor Counter Dome\nNarrows detection beam Reduces false triggers from adjacent areas Essential for doorways wider than 1m Check doorway width\nOptimal: \u003c1.2m wide Wider doorways reduce accuracy (side-by-side passages) Consider multiple sensors for wide openings (\u003e1.5m) Verify environmental conditions\nAmbient temperature should be 15-25°C Good thermal contrast (person vs environment) No direct sunlight exposure Check for heat sources\nMove sensor away from radiators Avoid HVAC vents Relocate if near heat-generating equipment Adjust sensitivity\nDecrease threshold (e.g., from 150 to 100) if missing detections Increase threshold (e.g., from 150 to 400) if too many false triggers Test during normal traffic hours Monitor for 24-48 hours\nSingle observations may be misleading Review trends over multiple days Compare to known traffic patterns Understand limitations\nMaximum 34 detections per minute Side-by-side passages may count as one Very slow movement may not trigger Not suitable for exact counting in high-traffic areas Expected Accuracy: 85-95% for single-file traffic in standard doorways\nFalse Occupancy Triggers (Desk Monitoring) Symptoms:\nDesk shows occupied when vacant Constant occupied status Triggers from people walking nearby Possible Causes:\nSensitivity too high Detection area too wide People walking nearby triggering sensor No Occupancy Dome installed Temperature variations from HVAC Solutions:\nIncrease threshold (reduce sensitivity)\nChange from 150 to 800 Focuses detection on immediate desk area Reduces triggers from walkways Install Occupancy Dome\nEssential for under-desk installations Dramatically reduces detection area Prevents detection of adjacent spaces Reposition sensor\nMove away from desk edge Center under desk Ensure 50mm clearance from objects Verify installation height\nShould be 60-70cm from floor Too high = larger detection area Use Mode 1 (Occupancy)\nProvides binary occupied/vacant status More suitable than movement counting Reduces false indications Check for walkways\nEnsure sensor not near high-traffic areas Adjust position if people pass very close May need physical barrier or different location Monitor HVAC effects\nTemperature drafts can cause false triggers Shield sensor from direct air flow Adjust placement if near vents With correct setup: 95%+ accuracy for typical desk usage\nPerformance Issues Short Battery Life Symptoms:\nBattery depletion faster than expected Low battery alerts before 2 years Frequent battery replacements needed Possible Causes:\nVery short report intervals High movement frequency LED enabled in production Dense network (many hops to gateway) Frequent configuration changes Extreme temperature environments Solutions:\nIncrease report intervals\nChange reportInterval from 60s to 300s Increase passiveReportInterval to 7200s or higher Reduces transmission frequency = longer battery life Use event-based modes\nMode 2 (Event-based movement count) instead of Mode 0 Mode 1 (Occupancy) for binary status only These modes reduce reporting when idle Disable LED\nSet enableLed to 0 LED uses power even though impact is small Should always be off for production Optimize gateway placement\nReduce number of mesh hops Fewer hops = less power per transmission Add gateway or mesh nodes if needed Minimize configuration changes\nAvoid frequent updates Each configuration change causes wake-up and transmission Configure once and leave stable Check environment\nExtreme cold (\u003c0°C) reduces battery capacity Warm sensor to room temperature Consider heated enclosure for very cold environments Review network density\nToo many sensors per gateway increases retransmissions Typical limit: ~100 sensors per gateway Add gateways if network saturated Use recommended batteries\nVarta Industrial Pro 1.5V AAA LR06 only Generic batteries have shorter life Never use rechargeable NiMH (lower voltage) Expected battery life with optimizations: 3-4+ years\nSensor Not Detecting Movement Symptoms:\nSensor reports 0 movements despite traffic moveCount always 0 No occupancy state changes Possible Causes:\nBatteries depleted Sensor in wrong mode Sensitivity too low Obstruction in detection path Temperature contrast insufficient Sensor malfunction Solutions:\nCheck battery level\nQuery battery status via cloud API Replace if voltage \u003c2.6V total Use multimeter to verify (should read \u003e1.3V per battery) Verify operating mode\nQuery configuration via Service API Ensure mode set correctly (0, 1, or 2) Reconfigure if needed Increase sensitivity\nDecrease threshold from current value Try threshold = 60-100 for maximum sensitivity Test with deliberate movement Check for obstructions\nRemove objects between sensor and monitored area Verify clear line of sight Check dome properly installed (not blocking sensor) Verify environmental conditions\nAmbient temp should differ from body temp (36-37°C) Best performance: environment 15-25°C Poor contrast reduces detection Test with deliberate movement\nWave hand directly under sensor Use normal walking speed (not too slow) Movement required (sensor doesn’t detect static presence) Check for sunlight exposure\nDirect sunlight overwhelms PIR sensor Relocate if in direct sun Shield sensor from bright light sources Verify sensor not damaged\nCheck for physical damage Ensure dome not cracked LED should still flash when enabled If still no detection: Contact support@haltian.com for replacement\nConfiguration Issues Configuration Not Applied Symptoms:\nSensor response shows old values Behavior doesn’t change after configuration No response to configuration message Possible Causes:\nSensor not joined to network Incorrect Wirepas endpoints CBOR encoding error Invalid parameter values Network congestion Configuration message not received Solutions:\nVerify sensor operational\nCheck sensor still reporting to cloud Ensure not in extended sleep mode Trigger movement to wake Check Wirepas endpoints\nMust be 21/21 for sensor configuration Verify in configuration tool or API Other endpoints will be ignored Validate parameter ranges\nReview valid ranges in Configuration Reference Out-of-range values may be rejected or clamped Use query message to see current values Retry during low-traffic period\nNetwork congestion can delay or drop messages Try configuration at night or off-peak Allow up to 60 seconds for response Increase timeout\nDon’t expect instant response Typical: 5-30 seconds Allow up to 60 seconds in dense networks Query current configuration\nSend empty configuration message (only header) Sensor replies with all current values Verify what sensor actually has configured Check transactionId\nInclude transactionId in request Verify response has same transactionId Helps match request to response If configuration still fails: Contact support@haltian.com\nParameter Value Clamped Symptoms:\nResponse shows different value than requested Threshold 50 requested, 60 returned Configuration partially applied Cause: Value outside valid range; sensor clamped to nearest valid value\nSolution: This is expected behavior. Sensor enforces valid ranges:\nthreshold: 60-1100 (values clamped to this range) enableLed: 0-1 (values clamped to 0 or 1) mode: 0-2 (values clamped to this range) passiveReportInterval: 0-86400 Review Configuration Reference for valid ranges and adjust request accordingly.\nNot an error - sensor protecting itself from invalid values.\nMaintenance Battery Replacement When to Replace:\nBattery level alerts from cloud (typically ~10% remaining) Sensor stops reporting messages LED no longer flashes when enabled Typically every 2-4 years depending on usage Replacement Procedure:\nOrder replacement batteries\nVarta Industrial Pro 1.5V AAA LR06 (recommended) Order 2 per sensor Purchase in bulk for multiple sensors Open sensor enclosure\nCarefully separate housing Avoid damaging internal components Remove depleted batteries\nNote polarity (+/-) orientation Dispose of old batteries properly Insert new batteries\nMatch polarity (+/- markings) Ensure proper seating in contacts Press firmly to secure Verify LED flash\nRed LED should flash once Indicates successful power-on If no flash, check battery installation Wait for network rejoin\nSensor reboots automatically Rejoins Wirepas network (2-5 minutes) Should resume normal operation Verify messages in cloud\nCheck for messages within 5-10 minutes Confirm configuration preserved Review battery level (should show ~100%) Battery Selection Guide:\nBattery Type Suitability Notes Varta Industrial Pro AAA ✅ Recommended Best longevity, cold performance High-quality alkaline AAA ✅ Acceptable Good performance Generic alkaline AAA ⚠️ Not recommended Shorter life Rechargeable NiMH ❌ Not recommended Lower voltage (1.2V) Cleaning Surface Cleaning:\nPrepare cleaning materials\nLint-free dry cloth For stubborn dirt: slightly damp cloth with water only No chemicals, solvents, or abrasives Wipe sensor surface\nGently wipe with dry cloth Remove dust and debris Pay attention to PIR sensor opening Dry if damp cloth used\nWipe dry immediately Do not allow moisture in battery compartment Ensure completely dry before leaving Cleaning Frequency:\nAs needed when visibly dirty Quarterly in dusty environments More frequent in high-traffic areas After construction or renovation work Dome Maintenance:\nCheck for cracks or damage Clean with dry cloth Verify secure attachment Replace if damaged (order through sales) Inspection Schedule Monthly Checks:\nVerify sensor still reporting to cloud Check for physical damage Ensure dome (if present) secure Review battery level in cloud Quarterly Checks:\nClean sensor surface Verify LED still functional (if enabled) Check mounting adhesion Review accuracy vs. known traffic patterns Inspect dome for cracks Annual Checks:\nFull functionality test Review placement effectiveness Consider sensitivity adjustment for seasonal changes Verify network signal strength (RSSI) Review battery life predictions Plan battery replacement if \u003c20% remaining Diagnostic Tools Cloud Monitoring Key Metrics to Monitor:\nMessage frequency -

This device can be used in various IoT use cases where extremely long battery life is needed. For example, high ceilings and other hard to reach locations are ideal for this accessory.\nWhen available, the Thingsee POWERCOVER will prefer the USB-power and switches to that from the battery power. It will also switch back to the battery power if the micro-USB power is lost. This provides extra power security during possible power outbreaks. Note that Thingsee POWERCOVER does not support battery charging.\nGeneral installation instructions Thingsee POWERCOVER is installed to the desired place with a double sided tape. The installation placement depends on the sensor that is used with the Thingsee POWERCOVER.\nThingsee POWERCOVER can be delivered either with the sensor device already installed to the Thingsee POWERCOVER or without it.\nThings to avoid in installation Avoid installing Thingsee products near the following:\nInstallation Thingsee POWERCOVER is delivered with batteries assembled inside. Pull away the battery security tab and the device is ready for use.\nThingsee POWERCOVER can be delivered either with the sensor pre-assembled or without the sensor device. If you need to assemble a sensor to Thingsee POWERCOVER, first remove the bottom cover and batteries from the sensor. The sensor can then be just snapped to its place on top of Thingsee POWERCOVER. Make sure that the direction of the sensor is correct for assembly. After snapping to its place, the sensor is ready for use.\nIf you need to open the device (e.g. for changing the batteries), use the opening key provided with the device.\nPlace the opening key to the slot between Thingsee POWERCOVER covers and bend the key away from the device.\nIf you change the batteries, please use Lithium batteries to ensure correct functionality. The recommended battery type is Energizer® Ultimate Lithium. When placing the bottom cover back, please note the correct direction of the cover.\nIf you want to remove the sensor from the Thingsee POWERCOVER, remove the batteries first. Place the straight end of the Opening Key to the slot inside the Thingsee POWERCOVER. Push the tool towards the sensor and the sensor is released.\nThe double-sided tape at the bottom of the device can be used for attachment.\nRemove the tape cover and attach the device to a clean, flat surface by pushing firmly for minimum of 5 seconds.\nUse IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol) to clean the attachment surface before installation.\nIf you want to ensure the attachment with screws, you can use an accessory available separately from Haltian Products.\nUsing micro-USB power source The recommended micro-USB power source is Sunny SYS1381N-1205-W2E (for Europe).\nVideo See the video here\n","categories":"","description":"Installation guide for Thingsee POWERCOVER accessory\n","excerpt":"Installation guide for Thingsee POWERCOVER accessory\n","ref":"/devices/accessories/thingsee-powercover/installation/","tags":"","title":"Installation"},{"body":"Video Tutorial Download PDF Download\nNote before installation Install the gateway to a secure location. In public places, install the gateway behind locked doors. To ensure strong enough signal strength for data delivery, keep the maximum distance between mesh network devices under 20m.\nIf the distance between a measuring sensor and the gateway is \u003e 20m or if the sensors are separated by a fire door or other thick building materials, use extra sensors as routers.\nThingsee installation network structure Thingsee devices build a network automatically. Devices communicate all the time to adjust the network structure for effective data delivery. Sensors create subnetworks for data delivery by choosing the best possible route based on signal strength. The subnetwork chooses the strongest possible gateway connection for data delivery to the cloud. The customer network is closed and secure. It cannot be harmed by third party connections.\nThe amount sensors per one gateway varies depending on the sensors’ reporting time: the longer the reporting time, the more sensor can be connected to one gateway. The usual amount is from 50-100 sensors per gateway to even up to 200 sensors. To ensure mesh network data flow, a second gateway can be installed on the other side of the installation site.\nThings to avoid in installation Avoid installing the Thingsee products near the following:\nData integration Make sure that data integration has been properly setup prior to the installation process.\nSee link https://support.haltian.com/howto/aws/\nThingsee data can be pulled (subscribed) from the Thingsee Cloud live data stream, or the data can be pushed to your defined end point (e.g. Azure IoT Hub before you install the sensors.)\nInstallation Please make sure the Thingsee GATEWAY LAN is installed before you install the sensors.\nTo identify the gateway, read the QR code on the backside of the device with a QR code reader or Thingsee installation application on your mobile device.\nIdentifying the device is not necessary, but it will help you keep track of your IoT installation and help Haltian support to solve possible issues.\nTo identify the device over Thingsee API, please check: https://support.haltian.com/api/open-services-api/api-sequences/\nConnect the power source to the gateway and plug it into a wall socket with 24/7 power. Note: Always use the power source included in the sales package.\nConnect the ethernet cable to the device.\nNote: The socket-outlet for the power source should be installed near the equipment and should be easily accessible.\nThingsee GATEWAY LAN is always ethernet connected: LED indication is used to provide gateway status information.\nThe LED on top of the device starts to blink:\nRED blink – Searching or cannot find Ethernet connectivity\nSimulatenous RED and GREEN blink – Ethernet connection working, but no cloud connection\nGREEN blink – normal operation, connected to LAN network\nChanging Green and Red blink – Firmware update\nTo close the device unplug the device.\nNetwork requirements Network services Thingsee GATEWAY LAN requires following services from the network.\nIP address allocated by DHCP What can go wrong? Ensure that the power outlet has 24/7 power output, so that we don’t loose the gateway e.g. in every night. In such case the system will recover once the power goes back up, but it is not optimal and causes some unnecessary stress to the devices and thus possible decreasing battery-life. Ensure that the gateway is hard or impossible to access by outsiders, so that it doesn’t get abused or stolen. If you have any trouble connecting the gateway, contact support@haltian.com Safety guide Read these simple guidelines. Not following them may be dangerous or against local laws and regulations. For further information, read the user guide and visit https://www.haltian.com\nUsage Do not cover the device as it may prevent the device from operating properly.\nSafety distance Due to radio frequency exposure limits the gateway should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the device and the body of the user or nearby persons.\nCare and maintenance Handle your device with care. The following suggestions help you keep your device operational. Do not open, dismantle or modify the device. Unauthorized modifications may damage the device and violate regulations governing radio devices. If the device is opened by an unauthorized representative, the warranty will be null and void.

Prerequisites Ensure Thingsee Gateway is installed and operational (LED blinking green) Verify power outlet available near installation location Plan sensor locations to maintain mesh network coverage (\u003c 20m between nodes) Identify doorways or passages to monitor (max 1000mm width, 2100mm height) Download Thingsee Toolbox app (iOS/Android) for configuration Planning Sensor Placement Key Considerations:\nMaximum passageway width: 1000mm (1 meter) Maximum passageway height: 2100mm Recommended installation height: 230cm from floor Power requirement: USB power outlet within reach of USB cable Direction configuration: Determined during setup (which side is “entry”) Passageway Suitability Ideal passageways:\nOffice doorways (meeting rooms, private offices) Retail entrances (stores, shops) Building corridors (hallways with defined passage points) Moderate width (\u003c 1000mm for single device coverage) Unsuitable locations:\nPassageways \u003e 1000mm width (requires multiple sensors or alternative technology) Areas with bright sunlight (direct exposure affects accuracy) Locations with incandescent/fluorescent/halogen lamps (prolonged light exposure) No power outlet available (use battery-powered sensors like Haltian ENTRYWAY instead) Network Coverage Planning Maximum distance: 20m between sensors or to gateway Use intermediate sensors as routers for distances \u003e 20m Wirepas mesh network automatically routes data Plan for reliable power at each sensor location (continuous operation required) Installation Overview Thingsee COUNT installation consists of several steps:\nCable threading: Run USB cable through cradle holder Sensor attachment: Install sensor unit to cradle Cable management: Secure cable with cradle clamp Mounting: Attach cradle to ceiling/wall (tape or screw) Power connection: Connect USB power supply Configuration: Scan QR code with Thingsee Toolbox app, set direction Step 1: USB Cable Installation Through Cradle Threading the Cable Take USB cable (included in package) Run cable through cradle’s holder: Insert cable through the hole at the back of the cradle Route cable to front: Pull cable through so connector end emerges at front where sensor will attach Connecting Cable to Sensor Unit Locate USB connector on sensor unit (back side) Orient connector springs upwards (critical for proper connection) Insert USB cable connector into sensor unit port Push firmly until you hear a small snap sound (confirms full insertion) Connector Orientation Ensure USB cable connector springs are facing upwards when connecting to sensor unit. Incorrect orientation may damage connector or prevent proper connection.\nCleaning Sensor “Eyeball” Before proceeding:\nInspect ToF sensor “eyeball” (front of device - circular lens) Remove any fingerprints or dirt with dry, clean, lint-free cloth Do not use liquids or cleaners (may damage sensor optics) Ensure lens clear for optimal detection accuracy Step 2: Installing Sensor Unit to Cradle Attaching Sensor to Cradle Hold sensor unit with USB cable attached Align sensor with cradle claws (two claws on cradle sides) Push sensor into cradle until it clicks into place Listen for subtle snap sound (confirms sensor firmly seated between claws) Cable Routing After sensor attached:\nRoute USB cable upwards or downwards at end of cradle Choose direction that avoids cable being squeezed between cradle and installation surface Ensure cable not strained (straight path, no sharp bends) Step 3: Installing Cradle Clamp (Cable Management) Securing the Cable Put USB cable into clamp groove (on cradle) Ensure cable straight (not strained, but without excess slack) Take cradle clamp (separate piece included in package) Snap clamp into place so it holds cable firmly Verify cable secure (cannot pull out easily) Purpose of clamp:\nPrevents cable from straining or pulling off sensor Maintains clean cable routing Provides strain relief for long-term reliability Installation Method 1: Tape Mounting Recommended for:\nSmooth surfaces (painted walls, ceilings) Temporary installations Locations where drilling not permitted Requirements Smooth installation surface (better adherence) Attachment plate accessory (included) IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol) for surface cleaning Step-by-Step Tape Installation 1. Attach Attachment Plate to Cradle Take attachment plate accessory Orient plate correctly (check alignment with cradle base) Snap plate into place at end of cradle Ensure plate fully attached (no gaps, flush with cradle) 2. Select Installation Location Choose spot directly above and in middle of passageway Verify height: 230cm from floor (recommended) Check angle: Cradle will point straight downwards at 90° angle Confirm power outlet accessible with USB cable length 3. Clean Installation Surface Use IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol) Wipe installation surface thoroughly Let dry completely (alcohol evaporates quickly) Ensure dust-free, clean surface for maximum adhesion 4. Apply Tape and Mount Remove tape’s paper backing (on attachment plate) Align cradle with marked position (centered, 90° downward) Press cradle firmly against surface Hold pressure for minimum 5 seconds Maintain pressure (can press for 30 seconds for better bond) Tape Installation Notes Wait 24 hours for tape to fully cure before expecting maximum holding strength Tape works best on smooth, clean surfaces (painted drywall, ceiling tiles, smooth wood) May not adhere well to textured surfaces (stucco, rough concrete) Installation Method 2: Screw Mounting Recommended for:\nPermanent installations Textured or uneven surfaces High-traffic areas (more secure than tape) Requirements Long Torx model screwdriver (specific to included screws) Screw(s) (included with cradle) Optional: Drill and wall anchors (for concrete/brick) Step-by-Step Screw Installation 1. Select Installation Location Choose spot directly above and in middle of passageway Verify height: 230cm from floor (recommended) Check angle: Cradle will point straight downwards at 90° angle Confirm no obstructions beneath installation surface (wires, pipes) Safety Check Before drilling or screwing, check for electrical wires, water pipes, or other cables beneath installation surface. If in doubt, consult facility manager or use electronic stud finder/wire detector.\n2. Mark Screw Position Hold cradle at installation spot Mark screw hole location with pencil (through cradle mounting hole) Verify alignment (centered on passageway, 90° downward angle) 3. Prepare Surface (if needed) For drywall/wood:\nPilot hole optional (screw can go directly into wood or drywall) Use pilot hole for hardwood to prevent splitting For concrete/brick:\nDrill pilot hole at marked location (appropriate drill bit size) Insert wall anchor (plastic or metal, appropriate for screw size) Tap anchor flush with surface 4. Install Cradle with Screw Align cradle mounting hole with pilot hole or anchor Insert screw through cradle into wall/ceiling Use long Torx screwdriver (included screw typically Torx head) Tighten securely (cradle should not rotate or move) Do not over-tighten (plastic cradle may crack) Step 4: Power Connection Connecting USB Power Route USB cable from cradle to power outlet Connect USB cable to power supply (included adapter) Plug power supply into power outlet Verify sensor powered (LED indicator should light - refer to sensor manual for LED patterns) Power Outlet Selection Important: Choose power outlet that is:\nNot on a switchable circuit (sensor needs continuous power) Reliable (if power lost, counter resets to zero) Accessible (for troubleshooting or future maintenance) Consider UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for critical counting applications to prevent data loss during power outages.\nStep 5: Configuration with Thingsee Toolbox Setting Up Direction (Entry vs. Exit) Configuration determines which side is “entry” and which is “exit”:\nOpen Thingsee Toolbox app on mobile device (iOS or Android) Scan QR code on front of Thingsee COUNT sensor Select location: IN or OUT IN: Install sensor inside room (e.g., inside meeting room door) OUT: Install sensor outside room (e.g., outside meeting room door, in corridor) App configures direction based on selection Verify configuration (app should confirm setup complete) Direction logic:\nSelection determines which side sensor considers “entering” the space Other side automatically considered “exiting” Test with walkthrough after installation to verify correct direction Post-Installation Verification Network Connection Wait for network join:\nSensor automatically joins Wirepas mesh network Typical join time: 1-10 minutes Gateway must be operational (LED blinking green) Verify in Haltian IoT Studio:\nLog into IoT Studio portal Navigate to device list Confirm sensor appears with correct ID Check “Last Seen” timestamp (should be recent) Detection Testing Baseline Test (Empty) Ensure passageway empty (no people in detection zone) Observe sensor for 5 minutes (should report no entries/exits) Verify LED indicator behavior (refer to sensor documentation) Entry Test Walk through passageway in entry direction: If configured IN: Walk from outside corridor into room If configured OUT: Walk from room toward corridor Complete full passage (walk through entire passageway beneath sensor) Check IoT Studio for “entries” count increment (may take 30-60 seconds to report) Exit Test Walk through passageway in exit direction: If configured IN: Walk from room toward outside corridor If configured OUT: Walk from corridor into room Complete full passage Check IoT Studio for “exits” count increment Directional Verification Entry direction test: Walk through in entry direction Verify “entries” increments, “exits” does not Exit direction test: Walk through in exit direction Verify “exits” increments, “entries” does not If incorrect: Reconfigure using Thingsee Toolbox app Scan QR code again, select opposite location (IN ↔ OUT) Simultaneous Passage Test (if applicable) Two people walk through simultaneously (side-by-side) Verify both counted (ToF sensor should detect both) If counts incorrect, verify passageway width \u003c 1000mm and sensor centered Signal Strength Check Review RSSI values in IoT Studio:\nGood signal: \u003e -70 dBm Acceptable: -70 to -85 dBm Poor: \u003c -85 dBm If signal poor:\nAdd intermediate sensor as router Relocate gateway closer Check for RF obstructions (metal structures) Installation Checklist Gateway operational and network ready (LED blinking green) Passageway width ≤ 1000mm Passageway height ≤ 2100mm Installation location selected (above doorway, centered, 230cm height) No bright sunlight or incandescent/fluorescent/halogen lamps Power outlet available and reliable (not on switchable circuit) USB cable threaded through cradle holder USB cable connected to sensor unit (connector springs upwards, snap sound heard) Sensor “eyeball” cleaned (lint-free cloth) Sensor unit installed in cradle (snap sound heard) USB cable routed to avoid squeezing Cradle clamp installed (cable secured) Attachment plate attached (if tape installation) Installation surface cleaned (IPA solvent, if tape installation) Cradle mounted securely (tape or screw method) USB power connected Sensor powered (LED indicator confirms) Direction configured (Thingsee Toolbox app, QR code scanned, IN/OUT selected) Device appears in IoT Studio Empty state verified (no false detections) Entry direction verified (walking through increments “entries”) Exit direction verified (walking through increments “exits”) Signal strength acceptable (RSSI \u003e -85 dBm) Simultaneous passage tested (if expected traffic pattern) Documentation updated (location, sensor ID, configuration) Common Installation Mistakes Mistake 1: USB Connector Springs Not Upwards Problem: Cable connector inserted with springs downward (incorrect orientation)\nImpact: Poor connection, sensor may not power on, or connector damage\nSolution: Remove cable, reorient with springs upwards, reinsert until snap sound\nMistake 2: Passageway Too Wide Problem: Passageway \u003e 1000mm width\nImpact: Detection coverage incomplete, missed counts at edges\nSolution: Install multiple sensors (side-by-side coverage), or use alternative sensor with wider range\nMistake 3: Installation in Bright Light Problem: Sensor installed in area with bright sunlight or incandescent/fluorescent/halogen lamps\nImpact: Accuracy reduced (light interferes with ToF laser)\nSolution: Relocate to area with moderate lighting, or use window shades to reduce sunlight exposure\nMistake 4: Power on Switchable Circuit Problem: Power outlet controlled by light switch or timer\nImpact: Sensor powers off when switch turned off, counter resets to zero\nSolution: Use dedicated outlet (not on switch), or move power connection to always-on circuit\nMistake 5: Cable Squeezed or Strained Problem: USB cable pinched between cradle and ceiling, or cable pulled tight\nImpact: Cable damage over time, connection failure\nSolution: Route cable upwards or downwards at cradle end, ensure no tight bends or pressure points\nMistake 6: Incorrect Direction Configuration Problem: IN/OUT configured opposite to actual installation location\nImpact: Entries counted as exits and vice versa\nSolution: Reconfigure using Thingsee Toolbox app, scan QR code again, select correct location\nSupport For installation assistance:\nEmail: support@haltian.com Thingsee Toolbox app: Configuration help User Guide PDF: Download Mesh network planning: Contact for

Thingsee LEAKAGE RUGGED is designed to detect the presence of water beneath the device. It activates when water covers the two detection pins located at the bottom of the sensor (effective in water layers wider than 2.4 cm).\nPlacement: For optimal results, position the sensor pins down in areas prone to water collection or where leaks are likely to occur first. For larger areas, consider using multiple sensors to ensure comprehensive coverage.\nApplications: This sensor is suitable for:\nSpaces where only small detection probes fit, such as narrow or corner areas. Locations such as drain pans, floor drains, and pits. Areas where water is likely to accumulate initially. Operation: Thingsee LEAKAGE RUGGED must contact a sufficient amount of water to trigger an alarm. Always verify that water flows to the sensor’s location either visually or through testing before installation.\nFunctionality: The sensor employs event-based messaging. It is set to report changes in water presence immediately, and stable conditions are reported hourly.\nSuitability: The Thingsee LEAKAGE RUGGED is specifically engineered for water leak detection. It should not be used with hazardous chemicals, solvents, oil, fuel, strong acids, or other corrosive substances. Performance may vary with different liquids; for instance, responses differ between tap water and seawater. Regular checks are recommended if a significant drop in measurement values is observed.\nData Interpretation: In dry conditions, the Thingsee LEAKAGE typically reports a value of 50,000,000. Adjustments to the baseline and alert levels may be necessary depending on the specific installation environment.\nRefer to the included illustration showing various values reported by the Thingsee LEAKAGE under different conditions without the Base and Detection Rope.\nThingsee LEAKAGE (without Rope \u0026 Base): When the sensor’s surface is wet and beginning to dry, you can expect to see values ranging from 800,000 to 50,000,000. Similar readings may also occur if the sensor’s pins are in direct contact with a conductive surface, such as metal or moisture-laden concrete with conductive additives. To avoid false readings, it’s crucial to use the included tape to slightly elevate the pins above the mounting surface. This ensures more accurate detection and helps prevent direct contact with conductive materials.\nBase for Thingsee LEAKAGE detects if the Detection Rope is missing, alerting users to improper installations; the Base must never be used without the Rope attached. When the Base and Detection Rope are attached to Thingsee LEAKAGE, the value this device combination reports is between 35 000 000 and 45 000 000 in dry conditions.\nThe illustration below shows the different values reported by Thingsee LEAKAGE when using the Base and Detection Rope.\nThingsee LEAKAGE with Rope \u0026 Base Expect values between 300,000 and 35,000,000 when surfaces are drying. However, readings between 7,600,000 and 8,300,000 suggest an incorrect installation. ** Thingsee Leakage with base but no rope attached.\nTo avoid false readings, make sure the installation surface is clean and free from debris, dirt, sticky residues, water spots, or other impurities that may be conductive and cause false positive values.\nInstallation Things to avoid in installation Avoid installing Thingsee products near the following:\nNote before installation Before installing the sensors, make sure the Thingsee gateway device is installed and connected to a mobile network (LED blinking green).\nPreparing the Sensor for installation: Identifying the Sensor: Scan the QR code on the front of the device using a QR code reader or the Thingsee Toolbox app on your mobile device. While this step is optional, it assists in managing your IoT setup and facilitates support from Haltian should issues arise.\nInitial state: Before installation, the sensor is in low power mode, indicated by a dimly blinking LED every second.\nActivating the Sensor: Use the Thingsee Sensor Activation Tool by holding it against the sensor’s magnetic switch. Keep it in place until the LED indicator blinks brightly for one minute.\nThe sensor is ready once the bright blinking stops and the LED turns off, indicating that the sensor is switched on and fully operational.\nInstalling the sensor on the floor Choose the Right Location:Place the sensor on the floor or any surface where leakages, moisture, or flooding may occur. Prepare the Surface:Ensure the installation area is clean and free from debris, dirt, sticky residues, water spots, or other impurities. Secure the Sensor:Use the provided adhesive tape to attach to the bottom of the device. This helps elevate the sensing pins above the monitored surface for accurate detection. Installing the Thingsee LEAKAGE Sensor with Base and Detection Rope accessories Attach the Base Accessory: Begin by snapping the Base accessory onto the Thingsee LEAKAGE sensor. Start from the side opposite the detection pins and then snap on the pins’ side. Press firmly until you hear a click. Ensure the Base is correctly oriented: the ‘Thingsee’ logo should be upright, with the screw attachment pointing upwards, as illustrated. Connect the Detection Rope Insert the Detection Rope into the designated port on the Base accessory. Position the Device: Choose a location for the sensor setup where you anticipate potential leakages. Secure the device using screws or zip ties. Note:Install the Base at a height to avoid direct water contact, as it is not waterproof. The Detection Rope should be laid directly on the monitoring surface. Ensure there is some slack in the Detection Rope to allow for proper laying.\nUsing the Sensor with Detection Rope Flexible Placement:The sensor setup can be coiled around pipes, laid alongside walls, or positioned on the ground. Surface Preparation:Ensure the installation area is clean and free from dirt, sticky residues, and other impurities. These substances may be conductive, potentially causing false-positive alerts if they bridge the gap between the detection line and the installation surface. Ensure the Detection Rope is thoroughly dried out after a leak has occurred. Secure Mounting:For added stability, mount the device on a wall using screws. Attach the Detection Rope extensively to monitor a larger area. Dos and Don’ts for Detection Rope Usage: Maintenance: Inspect the Detection Rope regularly, at least every 12 months.

This allows adjusting key parameters without physical access to the sensor.\nKey configurable parameters:\nSensing distance: 10 cm to 10 meters Measurement interval: How often sensor measures Reporting interval: How often data transmitted Operational mode: Parking, loading dock, or custom Note Configuration changes require access to Haltian Operations Cloud. Contact Haltian support if you need assistance with remote configuration.\nSensing Distance Configuration What is Sensing Distance? Sensing distance defines the threshold for occupancy detection:\nOccupied: Object detected within sensing distance Unoccupied: No object within sensing distance Adjustable range: 10 cm to 10 meters\nDefault Configurations Parking Space (default):\nSensing distance: 2 meters Rationale: Covers most passenger vehicles (sedans, SUVs) Coverage: Detects vehicles parked in typical parking space depth Loading Dock (default):\nSensing distance: 5 meters Rationale: Covers typical loading dock depth Coverage: Detects trailers backed into loading position How to Set Sensing Distance Considerations when choosing distance:\nMeasure your space:\nParking space: Measure depth from sensor to back of space Loading dock: Measure from sensor to trailer docking position Add margin for vehicle size variation (±0.5m typical) Avoid over-detection:\nDon’t set distance beyond intended monitoring zone Example: Parking space 5m deep, but walkway 6m away → set to 5m to avoid detecting pedestrians Account for vehicle types:\nCompact cars: 1.5-2 meters (shorter vehicles) Standard cars: 2-2.5 meters (most common) SUVs/Trucks: 2.5-3 meters (longer vehicles) Trailers: 5-8 meters (loading docks) Test and adjust:\nSet initial distance based on measurement Test with actual vehicles/trailers Fine-tune if false positives or missed detections occur Remote Adjustment Process To change sensing distance:\nContact Haltian support:\nEmail: support@haltian.com Provide sensor ID and desired sensing distance Explain use case (parking, loading dock, other) Haltian configures remotely:\nConfiguration pushed to sensor via Wirepas mesh Update typically applied within 1-24 hours Sensor automatically adopts new sensing distance Verify new configuration:\nTest with vehicle present and absent Confirm occupancy detection at expected distance Report any issues to Haltian support Future Self-Service Haltian may enable self-service configuration via IoT Studio in future updates. Contact support for latest capabilities.\nMeasurement Interval Configuration What is Measurement Interval? Measurement interval defines how often the sensor performs a radar measurement:\n30 seconds: Sensor measures every 30 seconds 60 seconds: Sensor measures every 60 seconds Custom: Other intervals (e.g., 5 minutes for battery optimization) Default Settings Parking Space:\nInterval: 30 seconds Why: Vehicles come and go frequently, rapid detection needed Loading Dock:\nInterval: 60 seconds Why: Trailers position slowly, longer interval provides more stable readings, extends battery life Impact on Battery Life Shorter intervals = More battery consumption:\nEvery measurement activates 60GHz radar → power consumption More measurements per day → faster battery drain Example battery life estimates:\n30-second interval: ~10 years (parking default) 60-second interval: ~10+ years (loading dock default) 5-minute interval: 15+ years (custom low-power application) Recommendation: Use defaults unless specific application requires different interval.\nWhen to Adjust Measurement Interval Increase interval (e.g., 60s → 5 min):\nLow-traffic areas (rarely used parking) Battery life more critical than rapid detection Loading docks with infrequent use Decrease interval (e.g., 60s → 30s):\nHigh-turnover parking (urban centers, airports) Critical applications requiring rapid detection (Battery life trade-off) Contact Haltian support to adjust measurement interval remotely.\nReporting Interval Configuration What is Reporting Interval? Reporting interval defines how often the sensor transmits data over Wirepas mesh network:\nOn state change: Transmit when occupied → unoccupied or vice versa Periodic: Transmit even if state unchanged (e.g., every hour) Default Reporting Behavior State change reporting (always enabled):\nOccupied → unoccupied: Report within next transmission cycle Unoccupied → occupied: Report within next transmission cycle Periodic reporting:\nEven if state unchanged, transmit periodically (e.g., hourly) Ensures system knows sensor is online Provides regular battery level updates Impact on Battery Life More transmissions = More battery consumption:\nRadio transmission consumes power Frequent transmissions reduce battery life Typical configuration:\nState change: Immediate (always) Periodic: Every 1-24 hours (when state stable) Recommendation: Default reporting balanced for typical use. Only adjust if specific application requires more frequent updates.\nWhen to Adjust Reporting Interval Increase periodic reporting frequency:\nReal-time parking guidance systems (need latest data) Critical applications (loading dock scheduling) (Battery life trade-off) Decrease periodic reporting frequency:\nLow-traffic areas (data updates less critical) Battery optimization priority Historical analytics only (no real-time need) Contact Haltian support to configure reporting intervals.\nOperational Mode Presets Parking Mode (Default for Parking) Pre-configured settings:\nSensing distance: 2 meters Measurement interval: 30 seconds Reporting: State change + hourly periodic Use cases:\nParking garages Street parking Commercial parking lots Residential parking Optimized for:\nRapid vehicle turnover Quick detection Typical passenger vehicles Loading Dock Mode (Default for Loading) Pre-configured settings:\nSensing distance: 5 meters Measurement interval: 60 seconds Reporting: State change + hourly periodic Use cases:\nWarehouse loading docks Freight terminals Distribution centers Retail receiving areas Optimized for:\nTrailer/truck detection Stable readings (tolerates vibrations) Extended battery life Custom Mode Fully customizable settings:\nSensing distance: 10 cm - 10 m (any value) Measurement interval: 30s, 60s, 5 min, or custom Reporting: Tailored to application Use cases:\nSpecialized applications (equipment monitoring, etc.) Unique environmental constraints Non-standard parking/loading scenarios Contact Haltian support for custom configuration assistance.\nActivation and Provisioning Initial Sensor Activation Before first use:\nPhysical installation:\nMount sensor in desired location Verify mounting secure and beam direction correct Network join:\nSensor automatically joins Wirepas mesh network Join time: 1-10 minutes (typical) No manual activation required Verify in Haltian IoT Studio:\nLog into IoT Studio portal Navigate to device list Confirm sensor appears with correct ID Check “Last Seen” timestamp (should be recent) Configuration assignment:\nSensor ships with default configuration (parking or loading dock) If custom configuration needed, contact Haltian support Configuration pushed remotely after network join Sensor ID and Identification Unique sensor ID:\nEach RADAR has unique device ID (printed on label) Use ID to identify sensor in IoT Studio Reference ID when contacting support for configuration Labeling best practice:\nNote sensor ID during installation Map ID to physical location (e.g., “Parking Space A12”, “Loading Dock 3”) Maintain installation records for future reference Advanced Configuration Options Mesh Network Role Sensor can operate as:\nEnd device: Only transmits own data (lowest power consumption) Router: Relays packets for other sensors (higher power consumption) Automatic role assignment:\nWirepas mesh automatically assigns roles Sensors closer to gateway more likely to be routers Optimal network topology managed automatically Manual role configuration:\nTypically not needed (auto-assignment optimal) Contact Haltian support if specific topology required Transmission Power Radio transmission power:\nDefault: Optimized for balance of range and battery life Adjustable: Can increase for challenging RF environments (reduces battery life) Contact Haltian support for transmission power adjustments When to increase transmission power:\nPoor signal strength (RSSI \u003c -85 dBm) Long distance to gateway (\u003e 20m, no intermediate routers) RF-challenging environment (metal structures, underground) Trade-off: Higher power = better connectivity but shorter battery life\nConfiguration Change Process Step-by-Step Configuration Update How to request configuration change:\nIdentify sensor:\nNote sensor ID (from label or IoT Studio) Confirm physical location Determine current configuration (if known) Determine desired configuration:\nSensing distance: Measure and calculate (include margin) Measurement interval: 30s, 60s, or custom Reporting interval: State change + periodic (specify frequency) Contact Haltian support:\nEmail: support@haltian.com Include: Sensor ID(s) Desired configuration parameters Use case description (parking, loading dock, other) Reason for change (if not obvious) Haltian applies configuration:\nConfiguration created in Haltian Operations Cloud Pushed to sensor via Wirepas mesh network Update typically applied within 1-24 hours Verify configuration:\nTest sensor with vehicle present and absent Confirm occupancy detection as expected Monitor for 24-48 hours to ensure stable operation Report any issues to Haltian support Configuration Rollback If new configuration causes issues:\nContact Haltian support immediately Describe problem (false positives, missed detections, etc.) Haltian can revert to previous configuration remotely Or adjust to alternative settings Multi-Sensor Configuration Management Configuring Multiple Sensors For deployments with many sensors:\nGroup by configuration type:\nGroup A: Parking spaces → 2m distance, 30s interval Group B: Loading docks → 5m distance, 60s interval Group C: Custom application → specific settings Provide sensor IDs per group:\nList all sensor IDs for Group A List all sensor IDs for Group B Etc.

The primary configuration is entry direction (IN vs. OUT), which determines how the sensor interprets people passing through the doorway.\nConfiguration method:\nScan QR code on sensor with Thingsee Toolbox app Select IN or OUT based on sensor placement Settings applied immediately to sensor No remote configuration:\nUnlike some Haltian sensors (RADAR, ENTRYWAY with remote config), Thingsee COUNT requires local configuration via Toolbox app Must be physically present with smartphone/tablet to configure Thingsee Toolbox Mobile App Download and Installation Download Thingsee Toolbox app:\niOS: App Store (search “Thingsee Toolbox”) Android: Google Play Store (search “Thingsee Toolbox”) Free download: No cost, available worldwide Requirements:\nSmartphone or tablet with camera (QR code scanning) Bluetooth enabled (for local communication with sensor) iOS 12+ or Android 6.0+ (recommended) Installation:\nDownload Thingsee Toolbox from App Store or Play Store Install app on smartphone/tablet Grant camera permission (required for QR code scanning) Grant Bluetooth permission (required for sensor communication) App Interface Main features:\nQR code scanner: Scan sensor QR code to identify device Direction selection: Choose IN or OUT entry direction Configuration confirmation: Verify settings applied successfully Device list: View previously configured sensors Entry Direction Configuration IN vs. OUT Selection The critical configuration for Thingsee COUNT is entry direction. This determines which way people entering vs. exiting are counted.\nIN Configuration (Sensor Inside Room) Use when:\nSensor installed inside the room being monitored Entry direction: Corridor → Room (into room) Exit direction: Room → Corridor (out of room) Example: Meeting room with sensor inside:\nPerson walks from corridor into room: “entries” increments Person walks from room out to corridor: “exits” increments Visual:\nCorridor [Entry →] Room [Sensor mounted inside room] ↑ (IN) OUT Configuration (Sensor Outside Room) Use when:\nSensor installed outside the room (in corridor) Entry direction: Room → Corridor (out of room) Exit direction: Corridor → Room (into room) Example: Meeting room with sensor in corridor:\nPerson walks from corridor into room: “exits” increments Person walks from room out to corridor: “entries” increments Visual:\n[Sensor mounted in corridor] Corridor [Entry →] Room ↑ (OUT) Direction Logic The IN/OUT setting defines which side the sensor is installed on:\nIN: Sensor inside room → Entry is “entering room” OUT: Sensor outside room → Entry is “exiting room” Choose based on physical sensor location, not desired count direction.\nConfiguration Steps Process:\nPosition near sensor: Stand within 2-3 meters of installed sensor Open Thingsee Toolbox app: Launch app on smartphone Scan QR code: Use app camera to scan QR code on sensor (usually on bottom or side) Wait for device identification: App reads QR code and identifies sensor Select direction: Tap IN or OUT button based on sensor placement IN if sensor inside room OUT if sensor outside room (in corridor) Confirm: App transmits setting to sensor via Bluetooth Verify: App displays “Configuration successful” or similar confirmation Test: Walk through doorway to verify entries/exits increment correctly Configuration time:\nEntire process: ~30 seconds to 1 minute Setting applied immediately (no reboot required) Verification After Configuration Post-configuration testing:\nCheck app confirmation: Verify “Configuration successful” message in Toolbox app Entry test: Walk from designated entry direction (corridor → room if IN, or room → corridor if OUT) Observe “entries” count in IoT Studio (may require waiting for next report, typically \u003c 5 minutes) Exit test: Walk from designated exit direction Observe “exits” count in IoT Studio Simultaneous test (optional): Have 2-3 people walk through together Verify all counted correctly Testing Delay After configuration, counts may not appear in IoT Studio immediately. Sensor reports data periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds to 5 minutes). Wait for next reporting interval, then check IoT Studio for updated entry/exit counts.\nReconfiguration When to Reconfigure Reasons for reconfiguration:\nSensor relocated: Moved from inside room to corridor (or vice versa) Incorrect initial direction: Entry/exit counts reversed Changed monitoring purpose: Different entry direction desired No reconfiguration needed:\nNormal operation (counts working correctly) Routine maintenance (cleaning lens, checking power) Reconfiguration Process Same as initial configuration:\nOpen Thingsee Toolbox app Scan sensor QR code Select new direction (IN or OUT) Confirm configuration Test with walkthrough Counter reset:\nReconfiguring direction may reset entry/exit counters to zero Document current counts before reconfiguring if historical data important Advanced Configuration (Via Haltian Support) Reporting Intervals Default reporting interval:\nPeriodic reports (exact interval set at factory, typically 30 seconds to 5 minutes) Contact Haltian support for current default Custom intervals:\nRequest custom reporting intervals via Haltian support Examples: Report every 10 seconds (high-frequency), every 15 minutes (low-frequency) Tradeoffs: Shorter intervals: More real-time data, higher network traffic Longer intervals: Lower network traffic, less real-time visibility Configuration method:\nCannot be configured locally via Toolbox app Contact support@haltian.com with device ID and desired interval Haltian support applies remote configuration (typically 1-2 business days) Count Thresholds (Trigger-Based Reporting) Alternative to periodic reporting:\nReport only when entry or exit count exceeds threshold Example: Report every 10 entries/exits (instead of every X minutes) Use cases:\nLow-traffic areas (report only when activity occurs, save network bandwidth) Event-driven applications (notification when X people entered) Configuration:\nContact Haltian support with device ID and threshold requirements Support configures trigger-based reporting remotely Configuration Best Practices Initial Installation Configuration ✅ Do:\nTest direction before leaving installation site (walk through and verify counts) Document direction setting in installation records (IN or OUT) Verify Toolbox app confirmation (ensure “Configuration successful” message) Take photo of QR code (for future reconfiguration if needed) Label sensor with entry direction (optional: sticker indicating “IN” or “OUT”) ❌ Avoid:\nAssuming direction without testing (always verify with walkthrough) Leaving site before verifying counts in IoT Studio (wait for first report) Configuring remotely without physical access (Toolbox app requires proximity) Documentation Recommendations Record in installation documentation:\nSensor device ID (from QR code or IoT Studio) Installation location (building, floor, room name, doorway) Direction setting (IN or OUT) Installation date and installer name Initial entry/exit count baseline (if applicable) Power outlet location (for future maintenance) Example documentation:\nDevice ID: abc123... Location: Building A, 2nd Floor, Conference Room 202, main entrance Direction: IN (sensor inside room) Installed: 2026-01-20 by John Doe Baseline counts: 0 entries, 0 exits Power: Outlet on west wall, circuit breaker panel #12 Network Configuration Thingsee COUNT network settings are automatic via Wirepas mesh:\nSensor automatically joins Wirepas mesh network after installation No manual network configuration required Network credentials pre-provisioned at factory Network requirements:\nHaltian Wirepas gateway within ~20m (direct line) or ~10m (through walls) Or other Wirepas sensors/routers within ~20m to relay data to gateway Adequate signal strength (RSSI \u003e -85 dBm recommended) Verifying network connection:\nCheck IoT Studio → Devices → Find sensor by device ID Verify “Last seen” timestamp (should be \u003c 5-10 minutes) Check Signal strength (RSSI): \u003e -85 dBm good, -85 to -95 dBm marginal, \u003c -95 dBm poor If not connected: Move sensor closer to gateway or add Wirepas routers/repeaters Troubleshooting Configuration Issues QR Code Scanning Problems Symptoms:\nToolbox app cannot read QR code “Invalid QR code” error App camera not focusing Solutions:\nClean QR code: Wipe dust/dirt from QR code sticker on sensor Improve lighting: Ensure adequate light on QR code (use flashlight if needed) Hold steady: Keep smartphone still while scanning (autofocus needs time) Angle adjustment: Try different angles (avoid glare or reflections) QR code damaged: If sticker damaged, contact Haltian support for device ID and alternative configuration method Direction Configuration Not Applied Symptoms:\nToolbox app shows “Configuration successful” but counts still reversed Entry/exit counts opposite of expected Solutions:\nWait for next report: Allow time for sensor to report (up to 5 minutes) Reconfigure: Scan QR code again and reapply direction setting Verify selection: Double-check IN vs. OUT selection matches sensor location Power cycle: Disconnect and reconnect USB power (may reset configuration to new setting) Contact support: If issue persists, contact support@haltian.com Bluetooth Connection Issues Symptoms:\nToolbox app cannot connect to sensor after scanning QR code “Device not found” error Configuration times out Solutions:\nEnable Bluetooth: Verify Bluetooth enabled on smartphone/tablet Move closer: Stand within 1-2 meters of sensor (Bluetooth range limited) Remove obstacles: Metal objects, thick walls may block Bluetooth signal Restart app: Close and reopen Thingsee Toolbox app Restart Bluetooth: Disable and re-enable Bluetooth on smartphone Try different device: Use another smartphone/tablet if available Counts Not Appearing in IoT Studio Symptoms:\nConfiguration successful but no data in IoT Studio “Last seen” timestamp old (\u003e 10 minutes) Zero entry/exit counts despite tested traffic Possible causes and solutions:\nNetwork not joined: Verify sensor joined Wirepas mesh Check RSSI and “Last seen” in IoT Studio Move closer to gateway or add routers if signal weak Power lost: Verify USB power connected and outlet active Check outlet not controlled by light switch Verify USB cable securely connected to sensor cradle Reporting interval: Wait for next report (may be several minutes) Contact support to verify reporting interval setting Sensor fault: If issue persists \u003e 30 minutes, contact support with

principle: Measures time for laser pulse to reflect off objects (people, floor) Distance accuracy: ±1-5% typical (millimeter precision) Detection range: 0-2100mm vertical (floor to ceiling) Advantages:\nWorks in darkness (laser provides own illumination) Temperature independent (measures distance, not heat) High precision (millimeter-level accuracy) Simultaneous passage detection (2-3 people side-by-side) Limitations:\nBright sunlight interference (laser wavelength affected) Certain artificial lighting interference (incandescent, fluorescent, halogen) Physical Specifications Dimensions and Weight Sensor unit (with cradle):\nLength: Approximately 80mm Width: Approximately 60mm Depth: Approximately 40mm (from ceiling/mounting surface) Weight: Approximately 100g (sensor + cradle + cable clamp) Cradle mounting system:\nCradle: Plastic housing for sensor attachment Cable clamp: Integrated cable management for USB cable strain relief Sensor unit: Detachable from cradle (snap-in design with springs) Installation Requirements Passageway dimensions:\nMaximum width: 1000mm (1 meter) Maximum height: 2100mm (2.1 meters, floor to ceiling) Recommended installation height: 230cm from floor Mounting methods:\nTape: 3M adhesive tape on attachment plate accessory (smooth surfaces) Screw: Permanent screw installation with Torx screwdriver (included) Mounting surface:\nCeiling, doorframe top, wall (horizontal orientation) Must support ~100g weight (sensor minimal load) Smooth, clean surface recommended for tape installation Power Specifications USB Power Requirements Input power:\nVoltage: 5V DC (standard USB voltage) Current: Typical ~100-300mA (sensor active continuously) Power consumption: Approximately 0.5-1.5W (typical for ToF sensors) Power supply:\nIncluded: USB wall adapter (5V, ≥500mA) Cable: USB A to micro-USB or USB-C (varies by model version) Cable length: Approximately 2-3 meters (adequate for ceiling-to-outlet routing) Power continuity requirements:\nContinuous power: Sensor must remain powered at all times No battery backup: Counter resets to zero if power interrupted UPS recommended: For critical applications where count must survive power outages Power Outlet Recommendations Suitable:\nDedicated outlet (not shared with high-power devices) Not controlled by light switch or timer Reliable circuit (minimal outages) Accessible for maintenance (disconnecting/reconnecting if needed) Unsuitable:\nSwitchable outlets (risk of accidental power-off) Outlets on overloaded circuits (voltage fluctuations) Temporary power strips (instability risk) Network Connectivity Wirepas Mesh Network Technology:\nProtocol: Wirepas Mesh (proprietary wireless mesh networking) Frequency: 2.4 GHz ISM band (same as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) Range: Up to ~20 meters to gateway (direct line of sight) ~10 meters through walls (varies by construction) Extended via mesh routers (other Wirepas sensors act as relays) Network behavior:\nAutomatic joining: Sensor automatically joins Wirepas mesh after installation Self-healing: Mesh automatically routes around failed nodes Low power: Optimized for battery devices (COUNT is USB-powered, not power-constrained) Data Transmission Measurement data:\nValues transmitted: Entries count, exits count, timestamp Data format: JSON payloads via Wirepas mesh to gateway Reporting frequency: Configurable (default typically 30 seconds to 5 minutes) Trigger-based reporting: Optional (report every X entries/exits instead of periodic) Payload example:\n{ \"measurementDirectionalMovement\": [ { \"deviceId\": \"abc123...\", \"entries\": 5, \"exits\": 3, \"measuredAt\": \"2026-01-20T14:30:00.000+00:00\" } ] } Network requirements:\nHaltian Wirepas gateway within range (~20m) Or Wirepas routers/repeaters to extend mesh coverage Adequate signal strength (RSSI \u003e -85 dBm recommended) Environmental Specifications Operating Conditions Temperature:\nOperating range: 0°C to +40°C (recommended, indoor use) Storage range: -10°C to +60°C (when not powered) Humidity:\nOperating humidity: 20% to 80% RH (relative humidity), non-condensing Storage humidity: 10% to 90% RH, non-condensing Atmospheric pressure:\nOperating: 86 kPa to 106 kPa (equivalent to sea level to ~1500m elevation) Environmental Protection Indoor use only:\nIP rating: Not specified (not designed for outdoor use) No weatherproofing: Not resistant to rain, snow, or extreme moisture Dust sensitivity: ToF sensor lens requires clean environment (dust reduces accuracy) Suitable environments:\nClimate-controlled offices, meeting rooms, retail stores Indoor passageways with moderate humidity and temperature Protected from direct sunlight (sun interferes with ToF laser) Unsuitable environments:\nOutdoor installations (no weatherproofing) High-moisture areas (risk of condensation on ToF lens) Dusty or industrial environments (lens contamination) Direct sunlight exposure (laser interference) Lighting Conditions Optimal Lighting Works best with:\nModerate indoor lighting (office lighting, overhead LEDs) Consistent lighting (not rapidly changing) Indirect sunlight (ambient light through windows, not direct sun) Lighting Interference Avoid:\nBright sunlight: Direct sunlight on sensor (infrared wavelength interference) Incandescent lamps: Certain wavelengths affect ToF laser accuracy Fluorescent lamps: May interfere with ToF measurements Halogen lamps: High IR output can confuse ToF sensor Rapidly changing light: Flashing lights, strobe effects Mitigation:\nInstall away from windows with direct sun Use window shades/blinds to reduce sun exposure Choose locations with LED lighting (minimal IR output, compatible with ToF) Performance Specifications Detection Accuracy Counting accuracy:\nSingle-file traffic: \u003e 95% accuracy (one person at a time) Moderate traffic: \u003e 90% accuracy (1-3 people per minute) Busy traffic: \u003e 85% accuracy (2-3 people side-by-side) Factors affecting accuracy:\nPassageway width (narrower = better, up to 1000mm max) Lighting conditions (moderate lighting optimal, avoid bright sun) Installation height (230cm recommended for optimal coverage) Walking speed (normal to fast preferred, very slow may be missed) Simultaneous Passage Capability:\nDetects 2-3 people walking side-by-side (within 1000mm width) Higher accuracy than PIR-based sensors for simultaneous passage Very crowded passage (\u003e 3 people simultaneously) may cause undercounting Measurement Specifications Count Data Measurement values:\nentries: Integer count of people entering (based on direction configuration) exits: Integer count of people exiting (opposite of entry direction) timestamp: ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2026-01-20T14:30:00.000+00:00) Counter behavior:\nIncremental: Counts increment by 1 for each detected passage Reset on power loss: Counter resets to zero if USB power disconnected No negative counts: Entries and exits always ≥ 0 Reporting Behavior Default:\nPeriodic reporting (e.g., every 30 seconds to 5 minutes, configurable) Transmits cumulative entries and exits since last report Optional trigger-based:\nReport when entry or exit count exceeds threshold (e.g., every 10 entries/exits) Contact Haltian support to configure trigger-based reporting Configuration

Dispenser Fill-Level Monitoring Applications:\nPaper towel dispensers in restrooms Soap dispensers (with liquid accessory) Hand sanitizer dispensers Tissue box monitoring Benefits:\nProactive refill scheduling (reduce empty dispensers) Optimize maintenance routes (refill only when needed) Usage analytics (identify high-traffic areas) 2. Trash Bin Fill-Level Monitoring Applications:\nOffice waste bins Public trash receptacles Recycling containers Compost bins Benefits:\nEfficient waste collection (empty only when full) Prevent overflowing bins (improve cleanliness) Route optimization (data-driven collection schedules) 3. Shelf Fill-Level Monitoring Applications:\nRetail shelf stock monitoring Warehouse inventory tracking Vending machine stock levels Parts bins in manufacturing Benefits:\nReal-time inventory visibility Automatic reorder triggers (low stock alerts) Reduce out-of-stock situations 4. Distance Measurement Applications Other uses:\nParking space occupancy (vehicle presence detection) Loading dock monitoring (truck presence) Tank level monitoring (liquids with accessory) Height measurement (stacked materials) How Thingsee BEAM Works ToF laser technology:\nLaser emission: Sensor emits infrared laser pulse toward target surface Reflection: Laser bounces off solid surface and returns to sensor Time measurement: Sensor measures time for laser to return (time-of-flight) Distance calculation: Time converted to distance (speed of light × time / 2) Data transmission: Distance value sent via Wirepas mesh to gateway and cloud Adjustable beam width:\nNarrow beam (15°): Precise measurement in confined spaces Wide beam (27°): Broader detection area for larger targets Beam width adjustable via configuration (contact Haltian support) Technical Highlights Specification Value Detection technology Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser Measurement range 40mm to 4000mm (4 meters) Accuracy ±25mm typical (varies with lighting and reflectance) Beam width (ROI) 15-27 degrees adjustable cone Installation angle 90° recommended (±6° tolerance) Minimum distance 40mm from target surface Power 2× AAA alkaline batteries (Varta Industrial Pro recommended) Battery life Multi-year (varies with reporting frequency and usage) Network Wirepas Mesh 2.4 GHz Range to gateway Up to 20m (mesh extends via other sensors) Mounting 3M adhesive tape (included) Environmental Indoor use, temperature/humidity tolerances typical for IoT sensors What Makes Thingsee BEAM Different vs. Ultrasonic sensors:\nHigher accuracy: ToF laser ±25mm vs. ultrasonic ±5-10cm typical Smaller beam: Narrow laser cone vs. wide ultrasonic cone (better for small targets) Faster response: Laser speed-of-light vs. sound wave travel time vs. Manual checking:\nContinuous monitoring: Real-time data 24/7 vs. periodic manual inspections Data-driven: Historical trends, usage patterns vs. subjective observation Labor savings: Automated alerts vs. manual inventory/refill checks Important Considerations Target Surface Requirements ✅ Works well with:\nSolid, matte surfaces (paper, cardboard, wood) White or light-colored targets (better reflectance) Stable, non-moving targets (trash, inventory) ❌ May have issues with:\nGlossy surfaces: Mirror-like reflections can scatter laser (metal, glass, polished plastic) Transparent materials: Laser passes through (clear plastic, water without accessory) Dark surfaces: Low reflectance reduces signal strength (black objects may measure longer distances) Moving targets: Constantly changing distance (use for static applications) Installation Angle Optimal:\n90° perpendicular to target surface (laser beam straight down/up) ±6° tolerance (sensor can handle slight angles without accuracy loss) Avoid:\nSteep angles (\u003e ±6°) cause measurement errors Angled glossy surfaces (laser reflects away, not back to sensor) Ambient Lighting ToF laser sensitivity:\nBright sunlight: Can interfere with laser measurements (infrared wavelength) Indoor lighting: Generally OK (office lights, LEDs compatible) Recommendation: Avoid direct sunlight on sensor or target area Quick Start Guide 1. Pre-Installation Verify Wirepas gateway operational (within ~20m of sensor location) Identify target surface (dispenser, bin, shelf) Verify target surface is solid and non-glossy Measure expected distance range (40mm-4000mm) Plan sensor placement (above or below target, 90° angle) 2. Installation Pull battery security tab (red LED flashes once) Clean mounting surface with IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol) Remove tape paper cover from sensor backside Press sensor firmly onto surface (5 seconds minimum) Verify sensor positioned at 90° angle to target Verify minimum distance (40mm from target) 3. Verification Sensor joins Wirepas mesh (check IoT Studio within 10 minutes) Distance measurement appears in IoT Studio Baseline measurement reasonable (compare to manual measurement) Test with fill-level change (add/remove items, verify distance changes) 4. Configuration Default beam width and reporting interval set at factory Custom configuration: Contact Haltian support for: Beam width adjustment (narrow vs. wide) Reporting interval changes (more/less frequent measurements) Threshold alerts (notify when distance \u003c X mm, indicating full) Data and Analytics Measurement value:\ndistance: Distance from sensor to target surface (millimeters) timestamp: When measurement occurred (ISO 8601 format) Typical payload example:\n{ \"measurementDistance\": [ { \"deviceId\": \"abc123...\", \"distance\": 350, \"measuredAt\": \"2026-01-20T14:30:00.000+00:00\" } ] } Fill-level calculation:\nBaseline: Distance when full (sensor to full dispenser/bin) Current: Real-time distance measurement Fill level %: (Current - Baseline) / (Empty - Baseline) × 100 Example: Bin full = 100mm, empty = 800mm, current = 450mm → Fill level = 50% Integrations Common use cases:\nBuilding management systems (BMS): Integrate fill-level data for facility management Maintenance scheduling: Auto-create work orders when bins full or dispensers low Inventory systems: Real-time stock levels from shelf monitoring Analytics dashboards: Visualize usage patterns, trends, and predictive maintenance Data access:\nHaltian IoT Studio (web interface, real-time and historical data) REST API (programmatic access for third-party integrations) Webhooks (push notifications on threshold events) Documentation Structure This guide is organized into focused sections:\nInstallation: Physical installation procedures, mounting methods, angle adjustment Operation: How ToF laser works, measurement behavior, battery management Configuration: Beam width, reporting intervals, threshold alerts (via Haltian support) Specifications: Complete technical specs, accuracy, environmental limits Troubleshooting: Common issues (glossy surfaces, angle errors, inaccurate measurements) Support Resources User Guide PDF:\nDownload Thingsee BEAM User Guide Includes installation visuals, use case diagrams, battery replacement Technical Support:\nEmail: support@haltian.com Subject: Include “Thingsee BEAM” and device ID Response time: 1-2 business days typical Configuration Assistance:\nBeam width adjustments (narrow vs. wide) Reporting interval changes Threshold alerts setup Use case-specific guidance (dispensers, bins, shelves) Next Steps New installation: Start with Installation Guide for step-by-step procedures Already installed: Review Operation Guide to understand measurement behavior Troubleshooting: See Troubleshooting Guide for common issues Technical details: Check Specifications for complete specs Ready to deploy Thingsee BEAM?

Include sensor ID, problem description, and troubleshooting steps already attempted.\nDetection Issues Sensor Reports “Occupied” When Space is Empty (False Positive) Symptoms:\nParking space or loading dock is empty Sensor reports “occupied” in IoT Studio Persistent or intermittent false positive Common causes:\n1. Sensing Distance Too Long Problem: Sensor detecting objects beyond intended monitoring zone (e.g., vehicles in adjacent parking space, pedestrians, walls)\nSolution:\nReview current sensing distance in IoT Studio (or contact support to check) Measure actual distance from sensor to monitored area boundary Request reduced sensing distance via Haltian support Example: If adjacent space 6m away, reduce from 5m → 4m Test after configuration change Expected outcome: False positives eliminated by limiting detection range to intended zone\n2. Obstructions Causing Reflections Problem: Radar beam reflecting off nearby objects (walls, poles, equipment) creating false detections\nSolution:\nInspect area within 17° detection cone from sensor Identify reflective surfaces (metal walls, poles, signage) Option A: Relocate sensor to avoid reflections Option B: Reduce sensing distance to exclude reflective object Option C: Remove/relocate reflective object (if possible) Expected outcome: Clear line of sight eliminates false reflections\n3. Sensor Angle Too Steep Problem: Sensor angled beyond 45° from perpendicular, causing beam to spread or reflect unexpectedly\nSolution:\nCheck sensor mounting angle Verify sensor face as close to perpendicular (90°) to monitored area as possible If angle \u003e 45°, physically reposition sensor Ideal: 0-30° from perpendicular Expected outcome: Proper angle focuses beam on intended area\n4. Environmental Interference (Rare) Problem: Other 60GHz devices or extreme RF noise (very rare)\nSolution:\nCheck for other 60GHz radar devices nearby (unlikely in most environments) Temporarily power off nearby electronics to test Contact Haltian support if interference suspected Expected outcome: Interference is rare; if confirmed, sensor relocation may be needed\nSensor Reports “Unoccupied” When Vehicle Present (Missed Detection) Symptoms:\nVehicle parked in space or trailer at loading dock Sensor reports “unoccupied” in IoT Studio Detection failure (vehicle not detected) Common causes:\n1. Sensing Distance Too Short Problem: Sensor range doesn’t reach vehicle detection point\nSolution:\nMeasure actual distance from sensor to vehicle (when parked/docked) Compare to configured sensing distance Request increased sensing distance via Haltian support Example: If vehicle 3m away but distance set to 2m, increase to 3.5m Test with vehicle in position Expected outcome: Extended range detects vehicle reliably\n2. Obstruction in Beam Path Problem: Object blocking 17° radar cone (post, sign, equipment, etc.)\nSolution:\nInspect clear line of sight from sensor to monitored area Identify any obstructions within 17° cone Option A: Remove obstruction (if possible) Option B: Relocate sensor to clear position Verify clear path after adjustment Expected outcome: Clear line of sight enables reliable detection\n3. Radar-Absorptive Vehicle Materials (Rare) Problem: Vehicle materials absorb 60GHz radar (very rare - most vehicles are metal and highly reflective)\nSolution:\nTest with different vehicles (cars, SUVs, trucks) If specific vehicle not detected but others are, may be material issue Contact Haltian support with vehicle type/model details Possible solutions: Reduce sensing distance (requires stronger reflection at closer range) Expected outcome: Most vehicles are radar-reflective; material absorption is extremely rare\n4. Sensor Mounting Height or Angle Wrong Problem: Sensor aimed above or below vehicle, missing target\nSolution:\nParking spaces: Verify mounting height 40-60 cm (knee height) Loading docks: Verify sensor aimed at trailer position (1-3m height typical) Check sensor angle - beam should point at vehicle detection zone Adjust mounting height or angle if needed Test with vehicle present Expected outcome: Proper height and angle ensure beam intersects vehicle\nIntermittent Detection (Sometimes Works, Sometimes Doesn’t) Symptoms:\nDetection unreliable (works for some vehicles, not others) Sporadic false positives or missed detections Inconsistent behavior over time Common causes:\n1. Vehicle Size Variation Problem: Small cars detected, large SUVs missed (or vice versa) due to fixed sensing distance\nSolution:\nIdentify range of vehicle sizes using space (compact cars → SUVs) Set sensing distance to cover full vehicle range Example: If cars 1.5m - 3m from sensor, set distance to 3m Test with smallest and largest vehicles Adjust if needed Expected outcome: Single sensing distance covers all vehicle types\n2. Environmental Conditions (Temperature, Humidity) Problem: While RADAR is generally stable, extreme conditions may affect performance\nSolution:\nCheck environmental conditions during failures (temperature, heavy rain, etc.) RADAR should work -35°C to +85°C and in rain/snow (IP68) If performance degrades in specific conditions, document and report to Haltian support Possible solutions: Sensor relocation, configuration adjustment Expected outcome: RADAR designed for extreme environments; issues rare but reportable\n3. Measurement Interval Too Long Problem: Vehicle parks briefly and leaves before next measurement (missed)\nSolution:\nReview measurement interval (30s parking default, 60s loading dock default) For high-turnover areas, shorter interval may help (trade-off: battery life) Request measurement interval reduction via Haltian support (e.g., 60s → 30s) Expected outcome: More frequent measurements catch brief occupancies (but reduce battery life)\nConnectivity Issues Sensor Not Appearing in IoT Studio Symptoms:\nSensor installed and powered Does not appear in IoT Studio device list “Last Seen” timestamp never updates Common causes:\n1. Sensor Not Yet Joined Wirepas Network Problem: Network join process can take 1-10 minutes (or longer in outdoor/sparse mesh environments)\nSolution:\nWait 10-15 minutes after installation Refresh IoT Studio device list If still not appearing after 30 minutes, proceed to next troubleshooting step Expected outcome: Sensor appears in device list within 30 minutes\n2. Out of Range from Gateway or Mesh Network Problem: Sensor \u003e 20m from gateway with no intermediate routers\nSolution:\nMeasure distance from sensor to nearest gateway or router sensor If \u003e 20m, mesh network cannot reach sensor Option A: Add intermediate sensor(s) as routers (\u003c 20m spacing) Option B: Relocate gateway closer to sensor Option C: Relocate sensor closer to network Expected outcome: Sensor within 20m of mesh network, joins successfully\n3. Gateway Offline or Not Configured Problem: Thingsee Gateway not operational\nSolution:\nVerify gateway powered and connected to internet Check gateway status in IoT Studio (should show “online”) If gateway offline, troubleshoot gateway (refer to gateway documentation) Restart gateway if needed After gateway online, sensor should join within 10 minutes Expected outcome: Gateway online, sensor joins mesh network\n4. Sensor Hardware Failure (Rare) Problem: Sensor defective (rare - quality control high)\nSolution:\nIf all other troubleshooting steps fail, hardware failure possible Contact Haltian support with sensor ID Report troubleshooting steps already attempted Haltian may send replacement sensor under warranty Expected outcome: Replacement sensor (if within warranty and confirmed defective)\nSensor Shows “Last Seen” Timestamp Outdated Symptoms:\nSensor appeared in IoT Studio previously “Last Seen” timestamp hours or days old No recent data updates Common causes:\n1. Sensor Moved Out of Network Range Problem: Sensor or gateway relocated, now out of range\nSolution:\nVerify sensor and gateway physical locations unchanged Check for environmental changes (new metal structures blocking RF) Verify intermediate routers still operational (check “Last Seen” on all sensors in path) If network topology changed, add routers or relocate gateway Expected outcome: Network connectivity restored, “Last Seen” updates\n2. Battery Depleted Problem: Battery drained (should last 10 years, but early depletion possible)\nSolution:\nCheck battery level in IoT Studio (if available from last report) If battery \u003c 10%, sensor may have shut down Battery non-replaceable → sensor end-of-life Deploy replacement sensor Expected outcome: If battery depleted, replace sensor\n3. Gateway Offline Problem: Gateway lost internet connection or powered off\nSolution:\nCheck gateway status in IoT Studio Verify gateway internet connection (ethernet or cellular) Restart gateway if needed Verify power supply Expected outcome: Gateway online, sensor data resumes transmission\n4. Wirepas Mesh Network Issue Problem: Mesh network disruption (interference, router failures)\nSolution:\nCheck signal strength (RSSI) in IoT Studio (if available from last report) If RSSI \u003c -85 dBm, signal quality poor Add intermediate routers between sensor and gateway Contact Haltian support for mesh network diagnostics Expected outcome: Improved mesh connectivity, data transmission resumes\nBattery Issues Battery Draining Faster Than Expected Symptoms:\nBattery level decreasing faster than ~10% per year Expected 10-year life, but draining in 5-7 years or less Common causes:\n1. Sensor Acting as Heavy Router Problem: Sensor relaying many packets for other sensors (router role)\nSolution:\nContact Haltian support to check sensor’s mesh network role If sensor is routing many packets, this is normal (trade-off for mesh connectivity) Option A: Accept shorter battery life (7-10 years still typical for routers) Option B: Add more routers to distribute load (Haltian can advise) Expected outcome: Heavy routers have shorter battery life (7-10 years vs. 10+ years for end devices)\n2. Measurement or Reporting Interval Too Short Problem: Sensor measuring or transmitting too frequently (custom configuration)\nSolution:\nReview measurement interval (should be 30s or 60s typically) Review reporting interval (state change + hourly typical) If intervals very short (e.g., 10s measurements), battery drains faster Contact Haltian support to adjust intervals (trade-off: slower updates vs. longer battery life) Expected outcome: Optimized intervals extend battery life\n3. Extreme Cold Environment Problem: Battery capacity reduced in very cold temperatures (\u003c -20°C)\nSolution:\nCheck environmental temperature range (sensor operates -35°C to +85°C) Battery chemistry (thionyl chloride lithium) capacity reduced in extreme cold If sensor in very cold environment (\u003c -20°C), shorter battery life expected Option A: Relocate sensor to warmer location (if possible) Option B: Accept shorter battery life, plan for earlier replacement Expected outcome: Cold environments inherently reduce battery life\n4. Defective Battery (Rare) Problem: Manufacturing defect (rare - quality control high)\nSolution:\nIf battery draining extremely fast (e.g., \u003c 2 years), may be defect Contact Haltian support with sensor ID and battery level history If within warranty and defect confirmed, replacement sensor provided Expected outcome: Replacement if defective and under warranty\nHow to Check Battery Level In Haltian IoT Studio:\nLog into IoT Studio portal Navigate to Devices → Device List Find Haltian RADAR sensor (search by sensor ID) View Battery field (percentage or voltage) Review historical battery level trend (if available) Battery level interpretation:\n100-80%: Excellent (sensor new or lightly used) 80-50%: Good (midlife, years remaining) 50-20%: Fair (monitor quarterly, plan for replacement) \u003c 20%: Low (plan for imminent replacement) \u003c 10%: Critical (sensor may stop functioning soon) Configuration Issues Unable to Change Sensing Distance or Measurement Interval Symptoms:\nWant to adjust configuration (sensing distance, intervals) No self-service option in IoT Studio Unclear how to change settings Solution:\nConfiguration via Haltian Support:\nConfiguration changes currently managed by Haltian remotely Email support@haltian.com with: Sensor ID(s) Desired configuration (sensing distance, measurement interval, etc.) Use case description (parking, loading dock, custom) Haltian applies configuration remotely (typically within 1-24 hours) Verify new configuration via testing (vehicle present/absent) Expected outcome: Haltian pushes configuration update to sensor\nFuture Self-Service Haltian may enable self-service configuration in IoT Studio in future releases. Contact support for latest capabilities.\nConfiguration Change Not Taking Effect Symptoms:\nRequested configuration change from Haltian support Sensor behavior unchanged after stated update time Common causes:\n1. Configuration Not Yet Applied Problem: Update in progress (can take up to 24 hours)\nSolution:\nConfirm when Haltian confirmed configuration push (check email) Wait up to 24 hours for sensor to receive and apply update Sensor must wake up and check for configuration updates If \u003e 24 hours since Haltian confirmed, contact support Expected outcome: Configuration applied within 24 hours\n2. Sensor Out of Network Range During Update Problem: Sensor offline when configuration pushed\nSolution:\nVerify sensor “Last Seen” timestamp recent (\u003c 1 hour) If sensor offline, configuration cannot be received Restore sensor connectivity (see “Connectivity Issues” section) Once online, configuration should apply automatically Expected outcome: Configuration applies once sensor back online\n3. Configuration Applied to Wrong Sensor Problem: Multiple sensors, configuration applied to different sensor ID\nSolution:\nVerify sensor ID in request to Haltian support Check sensor ID in IoT Studio (ensure correct sensor) Contact Haltian support to confirm configuration applied to correct sensor ID Re-request configuration for correct sensor if needed Expected outcome: Configuration applied to correct sensor\nData Quality Issues Distance Values Fluctuating Wildly Symptoms:\nReported distance values inconsistent (e.g., 1.5m → 8.2m → 1.8m in consecutive measurements) Erratic distance readings even when space stable (empty or occupied) Common causes:\n1. Sensor Vibration or Movement Problem: Sensor mounting loose, vibrating, or shifting\nSolution:\nInspect sensor mounting hardware Tighten screws/bolts if loose Verify mounting surface stable (not vibrating wall or pole) Re-secure sensor, ensure level and aimed correctly Test distance measurements after re-securing Expected outcome: Stable mounting yields consistent distance readings\n2. Multi-Path Reflections Problem: Radar reflecting off multiple surfaces (walls, ceiling, floor) causing interference\nSolution:\nInspect environment for reflective surfaces near sensor Option A: Relocate sensor to reduce reflections Option B: Reduce sensing distance to limit range of reflections Option C: Contact Haltian support for advanced troubleshooting Expected outcome: Minimizing reflections stabilizes distance readings\n3. Obstruction Moving in/out of Beam Problem: Object (e.g., person, equipment) occasionally passing through 17° cone\nSolution:\nObserve monitored area during measurement intervals Check for transient objects (pedestrians, shopping carts, forklifts, etc.) Option A: Accept transient fluctuations (normal in active environments) Option B: Adjust sensing distance to exclude transient objects Option C: Increase measurement interval to filter brief obstructions (e.g., 30s → 60s) Expected outcome: Transient objects cause brief fluctuations (normal); longer intervals smooth data\nOccupancy State Flapping (Rapid Occupied ↔ Unoccupied) Symptoms:\nOccupancy state toggling rapidly (occupied → unoccupied → occupied within minutes) No actual vehicle coming and going that quickly “Flapping” behavior Common causes:\n1. Sensing Distance at Edge of Vehicle Detection Problem: Distance threshold exactly at vehicle edge (small movements cause state change)\nSolution:\nIf vehicle 2.0m away and sensing distance 2.0m, tiny movements cause flapping Increase sensing distance by 0.3-0.5m margin (e.g., 2.0m → 2.5m) Provides buffer zone, reduces edge-case flapping Request adjustment via Haltian support Expected outcome: Margin eliminates flapping for stable vehicles\n2. Transient Obstructions Problem: People, shopping carts, etc. briefly triggering occupancy\nSolution:\nSame as “Obstruction Moving in/out of Beam” above Reduce sensing distance to exclude transient objects Or accept transient triggers as normal in high-traffic areas Expected outcome: Reduced sensing distance limits transient triggers\nPerformance Optimization How to Maximize Battery Life Best practices:\nUse default intervals: 30s (parking) or 60s (loading dock) optimized Avoid excessive reporting: State change + hourly is optimal Plan mesh topology: Minimize sensor router role (direct path to gateway) Monitor battery trend: Review quarterly, plan replacement proactively Trade-offs:\nLonger intervals = longer battery, but slower detection Fewer transmissions = longer battery, but less frequent data Router role = shorter battery, but essential for mesh connectivity How to Improve Detection Accuracy Best practices:\nProper sensing distance: Measure space, add 0.3-0.5m margin Perpendicular mounting: 0-30° angle ideal, \u003c 45° maximum Clear line of sight: No obstructions in 17° cone Appropriate height: 40-60 cm for parking, 1-3m for loading docks Test with multiple vehicles: Verify detection across vehicle sizes Expected outcome: \u003e 95% detection accuracy with proper configuration\nHow to Reduce False Positives Best practices:\nSet sensing distance precisely: Don’t over-extend beyond monitored zone Avoid reflective surfaces: Clear reflections from metal walls, poles Perpendicular mounting: Minimize multi-path reflections Expected outcome: \u003c 1% false positive rate with proper configuration\nCommon Error Messages “Sensor Offline” in IoT Studio Meaning: Sensor hasn’t communicated with gateway recently (threshold varies, typically 1-24 hours)\nSolution: See “Sensor Shows ‘Last Seen’ Timestamp Outdated” section above\n“Low Battery” Alert Meaning: Battery level below threshold (e.g., \u003c 20%)\nSolution:\nNote battery level percentage If \u003c 20%, plan for sensor replacement within months If \u003c 10%, replace sensor soon (may stop functioning) Battery non-replaceable → deploy new sensor “Configuration Error” (if shown) Meaning: Sensor received invalid configuration or failed to apply\nSolution:\nContact Haltian support immediately Provide sensor ID and error details Haltian will push corrected configuration Advanced Troubleshooting Using Signal Strength (RSSI) to Diagnose Issues RSSI interpretation:\n\u003e -70 dBm: Excellent signal (strong mesh connectivity) -70 to -85 dBm: Good signal (acceptable) \u003c -85 dBm: Poor signal (connectivity issues likely) If RSSI poor (\u003c-85 dBm):\nAdd intermediate router sensors (\u003c 20m spacing) Relocate gateway closer Check for RF obstructions (metal structures, underground) Verifying Mesh Network Path With Haltian support:\nContact support@haltian.com with sensor ID Request mesh network path diagnostics Haltian can trace packet route from sensor → routers → gateway Identify weak links or missing routers Haltian recommends topology improvements Factory Reset (if available) Not typically user-accessible:\nSensors generally cannot be factory

sensor\n","ref":"/devices/sensors/haltian-radar/troubleshooting/","tags":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"body":"Quick Diagnostics Basic Checks Before detailed troubleshooting:\nBatteries installed correctly (polarity matched) LED flashed on battery installation Gateway operational (green blinking LED) Sensor within 20m of gateway or another sensor 48+ hours elapsed for TVOC baseline calibration At least one heartbeat interval (1 hour) has passed LED Indicators Thingsee AIR has minimal LED feedback:\nSingle flash on power-on: Normal operation startup No continuous LED: Normal (preserves battery life) Note: Unlike gateways, sensors do not have constant LED indication. This is by design to maximize battery life.\nInstallation Issues LED Not Flashing on Battery Installation Symptoms:\nNo LED flash when batteries inserted No indication of power Possible Causes:\nBatteries inserted incorrectly Batteries depleted or defective Battery contacts not making connection Sensor malfunction Solutions:\nVerify battery polarity\nCheck +/- orientation matches compartment markings Both batteries must be inserted correctly Ensure batteries fully seated in contacts Try fresh batteries\nUse recommended: Varta Industrial Pro 1.5V AA LR06 Test with multimeter: should read \u003e1.4V per battery Avoid mixing old and new batteries Check battery contacts\nInspect for corrosion or damage Gently clean contacts with isopropyl alcohol if needed Ensure spring contacts not compressed/damaged Remove and reinsert batteries\nTake both batteries out Wait 10 seconds Reinsert with correct polarity Should see brief LED flash Verify A-cover and B-cover connection\nEnsure covers properly aligned Press firmly together until click Internal connection may be loose if covers not fully seated If still no response:\nSensor may be defective Contact support@haltian.com with sensor ID Sensor Not Appearing in Cloud Symptoms:\nSensor not listed in Haltian IoT Studio No data received after installation “Last Seen” shows never or very old timestamp Possible Causes:\nGateway not operational or not connected Sensor not joined to Wirepas network Network coverage issue (sensor too far from gateway) Sensor not provisioned correctly First heartbeat interval not yet elapsed Solutions:\nVerify gateway operational\nCheck gateway LED status (should be blinking green) Confirm gateway has internet connectivity Verify gateway appears “Online” in IoT Studio Test gateway with another known-working sensor Confirm network coverage\nSensor must be within 20m of gateway or another sensor Check for physical obstructions: Thick concrete walls Metal structures or equipment Fire doors Add intermediate sensors as routers if needed Use Thingsee Toolbox app to check signal strength Wait for first message\nDefault heartbeat: 1 hour First message may take up to 60-90 minutes Sensor joins network, then waits for first report interval Be patient during initial deployment Trigger a report manually\nChange environment significantly: Breathe directly on sensor (increases CO₂ and humidity) Warm sensor with hands (temperature change) Should trigger event report within 5-10 minutes Verifies sensor is operational and transmitting Verify sensor provisioning\nCheck sensor was added to correct project in IoT Studio Verify sensor ID matches QR code label Confirm network ID and keys match gateway Contact Haltian support if provisioning uncertain Check IoT Studio device list\nFilter by location or installation date Search for sensor ID or name Verify not accidentally in different project/location Check “Inactive Devices” view Power cycle the

Sensor ID (from QR code) Installation location Gateway ID Approximate installation time Poor Signal Strength (RSSI) Symptoms:\nRSSI values \u003c -85 dBm in IoT Studio Intermittent data reception Long gaps between messages “Last Seen” timestamp frequently old Possible Causes:\nSensor too far from gateway or mesh network Physical obstructions blocking signal RF interference from other devices Suboptimal mesh network density Solutions:\nCheck distance to gateway\nShould be \u003c 20m from gateway or another sensor Measure straight-line distance (not walking path) Account for floor height in multi-story buildings Identify obstructions\nMetal structures, filing cabinets, equipment Concrete walls, especially with rebar Fire doors (metal core) Large HVAC ducts Solution: Relocate sensor or add mesh routers Add intermediate sensors\nDeploy additional sensors between isolated sensor and gateway Each sensor acts as mesh router Creates redundant paths for data Improves overall network reliability Optimize mesh density\nRecommended: 1 sensor per 20m radius Higher density = better signal, lower battery drain Mesh self-optimizes routing Check for RF interference\nCommon sources: WiFi routers on 2.4 GHz (channels 1-11 overlap BLE) Microwave ovens Bluetooth devices (speakers, headphones) Wireless presentation systems Solution: Relocate sensor away from interference sources Contact Haltian for frequency analysis if severe Verify gateway placement\nGateway should be centrally located Elevated position (on wall, not floor) Away from metal cabinets or equipment racks Good gateway placement improves entire network RSSI Guidelines:\n\u003e -60 dBm: Excellent (no action needed) -60 to -70 dBm: Good (acceptable) -70 to -85 dBm: Fair (monitor, consider optimization) \u003c -85 dBm: Poor (action required) Data Quality Issues CO₂ Readings Seem Incorrect Symptoms:\nCO₂ never drops below 600-800 ppm (should reach ~410 ppm) Consistently high readings even when space unoccupied Baseline seems incorrect Possible Causes:\nInsufficient baseline calibration period (\u003c 8 days) No “free of people” periods with fresh air exchange Poor ventilation in space (actual high CO₂) Sensor placed in continuously occupied area Solutions:\nVerify calibration period\nHas sensor been operating for 8+ days? CO₂ baseline calibration requires 8-day cycle Data improves after first full calibration period Confirm “free of people” periods\nSpace must have regular unoccupied times Indoor air must fully exchange with outdoor air Typical in: Offices (nights, weekends) Schools (evenings, holidays) Retail (closed hours) Not suitable for: 24/7 occupied spaces Poorly ventilated rooms Areas never fully air-exchanged Check ventilation\nHigh readings may be ACCURATE indication of poor ventilation Verify HVAC system operational Test: Open windows for 30 minutes CO₂ should drop toward 410 ppm if ventilation was issue If not dropping, sensor may need support evaluation Verify sensor placement\nShould be in representative location, not: Directly in exhaust airflow In sealed cabinet or enclosed space Behind furniture blocking airflow Wait for automatic baseline correction\nABC (Automatic Baseline Correction) adjusts over time Targets 410 ppm as fresh air baseline May take 2-3 calibration cycles (16-24 days) to fully stabilize Contact support for manual baseline reset\nIf after 3-4 weeks baseline still incorrect Provide example readings and installation details Support can remotely trigger baseline reset Expected behavior:\nOccupied hours: 600-1500 ppm (depending on occupancy and ventilation) Unoccupied (night): Drops toward 410 ppm Early morning: Low point ~410-500 ppm before occupancy TVOC Readings Unstable or High Symptoms:\nTVOC fluctuates wildly Consistently high readings \u003e 2200 ppb Readings don’t stabilize after 48 hours Possible Causes:\nBaseline calibration period incomplete (\u003c 48 hours) Recent cleaning with strong products New furniture, carpets, or building materials off-gassing Actual VOC sources in environment Sensor too close to VOC source (cleaning closet, printers, etc.) Solutions:\nVerify 48-hour calibration complete\nTVOC requires 48 hours continuous operation for valid baseline Early readings (first 48h) may be inaccurate Wait for baseline to establish Identify VOC sources\nRecent cleaning? Use less aggressive products New furniture? Off-gassing can last days to weeks Printers/copiers nearby? Relocate sensor Air fresheners or scented products? Remove or relocate Cooking odors? Increase ventilation Improve ventilation\nIncrease fresh air intake if TVOC consistently high Open windows to flush VOCs Monitor over days to see if levels decline Persistent high levels indicate actual air quality issue Relocate sensor if too close to source\nShould represent general room air, not localized emissions Minimum 2-3m from known VOC sources Avoid placement near: Cleaning supply closets Office equipment (printers, copiers) Break rooms with microwaves/coffee makers Document recent changes\nNew paint, flooring, furniture? Construction or renovation? Change in cleaning schedule or products? TVOC spikes often correlate with building changes Wait for natural decline\nNew building materials off-gas for weeks to months TVOC will gradually decline as sources dissipate Monitor trend over time (should decrease) Normal TVOC patterns:\nGradual decline over days/weeks after installation (sensor or building new) Morning spike after cleaning (dissipates in hours) Stable low levels (\u003c 220 ppb) in well-ventilated, aged buildings Higher in new buildings or after renovations (temporary) Temperature or Humidity Readings Seem Wrong Symptoms:\nTemperature significantly different from thermostat or other sensors Humidity readings don’t match other devices Possible Causes:\nSensor in microclimate (direct sun, near heat source, in airflow) Comparison device inaccurate or poorly placed Sensor not yet acclimated to environment Normal variation due to different sensor locations Solutions:\nVerify sensor placement\nNot in direct sunlight? Not near heating/cooling vents? Not above radiators or heat sources? Not in cold draft from window? Relocate if in microclimate Allow acclimation time\nAfter installation or battery change, wait 15-30 minutes Sensor needs to equilibrate to room temperature Humidity sensor especially needs stabilization time Compare to calibrated reference\nThermostat may be in different location (different temperature) Consumer humidity meters often inaccurate (±5-10% typical) Use NIST-traceable reference if available Thingsee AIR: ±0.2°C temp, ±2% RH accuracy Understand temperature variation in spaces\n2-3°C variation normal in same room (near window vs. interior wall) Vertical stratification: warmer near ceiling Thingsee AIR at 1.5m height may differ from floor-level thermostat Check for thermal sources\nSun exposure through windows (even indirect) Nearby computers, monitors, or equipment Heat from lighting fixtures Solution: Relocate sensor to representative location If readings still seem incorrect:\nDocument: exact values, comparison device specs, installation location Contact support for sensor verification Support can review historical data for anomalies Battery Issues Battery Life Shorter Than Expected Symptoms:\nBattery level dropping faster than 4-year expected life Frequent low battery warnings Battery depleted in \u003c 2 years Possible Causes:\nHigh reporting frequency (custom configuration) Poor signal strength (many retransmissions) Sensor acting as mesh router for many other devices Low-quality or old batteries Operating in cold environment Solutions:\nReview configuration\nCheck reporting thresholds in IoT Studio Very low thresholds = frequent reports = more battery use Default thresholds optimal for battery life Contact support to optimize configuration Improve signal strength\nPoor RSSI (\u003c -85 dBm) causes retransmissions Add intermediate sensors to improve mesh Better signal = less power for each transmission See “Poor Signal Strength” section above Check mesh network density\nIf sensor is routing for many others, power consumption higher Verify balanced mesh network Contact support for network topology review Verify battery quality\nUse recommended: Varta Industrial Pro 1.5V AA LR06 Avoid bargain or off-brand batteries Check expiration date on batteries Old batteries (\u003e 1-2 years in storage) have reduced capacity Operating temperature\nCold environments reduce battery capacity Alkaline batteries lose capacity below +10°C If sensor in cold area, battery life will be shorter Consider more frequent replacement schedule Calculate actual battery life\nCheck installation date vs. current battery level 4-year estimate assumes default configuration Higher frequency configurations reduce battery life proportionally 25% remaining after 3 years = 4-year life on track Battery life estimates by configuration:\nStandard (default 5-min minimum interval): 4 years High frequency (1-min minimum interval): 2-3 years Optimized (15-min minimum interval): 5-6 years Low Battery Warning but Batteries Recently Replaced Symptoms:\nLow battery alert shortly after installing new batteries Battery level drops rapidly from 100% Possible Causes:\nBatteries not fresh (old stock) Poor quality batteries Battery contacts not making good connection Sensor reporting inaccurate battery level Very cold environment Solutions:\nVerify battery freshness\nCheck expiration date on battery packaging Batteries have ~2-3 year shelf life Old stock may have reduced capacity Test battery voltage\nUse multimeter to test new batteries before installation Should read 1.5-1.6V per battery when fresh \u003c 1.4V indicates depleted or defective battery Try different battery brand\nUse recommended: Varta Industrial Pro AA Alkaline batteries required (not lithium, not rechargeable NiMH) Consistent quality from reputable brand Clean battery contacts\nRemove batteries Gently clean contacts with isopropyl alcohol Ensure spring contacts not damaged Reinsert fresh batteries Check environmental temperature\nBattery level calculation affected by extreme cold Below +10°C, apparent capacity reduces If sensor in cold zone, level indication may be pessimistic Wait 24 hours\nBattery level calculation may need time to stabilize If drops to \u003c 20% within 24 hours, batteries defective If stabilizes at reasonable level, normal operation If issue persists:\nTry completely different battery batch Document battery brand, expiration, measured voltage Contact support with sensor ID and battery details Network and Connectivity Issues Sensor Reporting Intermittently Symptoms:\nGaps in data (missing hours or days) “Last Seen” timestamp irregular Messages arrive in bursts, then silence Possible Causes:\nBorderline signal strength (RSSI near -85 dBm) Gateway intermittent connectivity or reboots Temporary RF interference Mesh network instability Sensor in transitional coverage area Solutions:\nCheck signal strength trends\nReview RSSI history in IoT Studio If hovering around -85 dBm, borderline coverage Add intermediate sensor to improve link Verify gateway stability\nCheck gateway uptime and connectivity Gateway reboots cause temporary sensor silence Review gateway logs for issues Monitor for patterns\nDo gaps occur at specific times? (interference) Random gaps or consistent time of day? Pattern may indicate external cause (e.g., microwave use during lunch) Add mesh redundancy\nDeploy additional sensors in area Creates multiple routing paths Improves network resilience Check for physical obstructions (transient)\nDoors opening/closing People or equipment moved temporarily Changes in space layout Review mesh network health\nContact Haltian support for network analysis Support can review network topology Identify routing bottlenecks or weak links Expected behavior:\nContinuous reports (every 5-60 minutes depending on activity) Maximum gap should be heartbeat interval (default 1 hour) Occasional 2-hour gap acceptable (one missed heartbeat) Gaps \u003e 3 hours indicate problem No Data After Battery Replacement Symptoms:\nSensor was working, stopped after battery change LED flashed on new battery installation But no data received in cloud Possible Causes:\nSensor not rejoined to network after reboot Network credentials lost (unlikely but possible) Configuration reset (rare) Batteries inserted incorrectly despite LED flash Solutions:\nWait for network rejoin\nAfter battery replacement, sensor reboots Network rejoin can take 1-10 minutes First data may arrive after first heartbeat (up to 1 hour) Be patient, wait 1-2 hours Verify batteries correctly installed\nDouble-check polarity markings Both batteries must be correctly oriented LED flash doesn’t guarantee proper operation if one battery reversed Power cycle again\nRemove both batteries Wait 30 seconds Reinsert carefully (correct polarity) Wait 1 hour for first report Check IoT Studio device list\nSensor should still be listed (not removed) If missing, may need reprovisioning Contact support if device disappeared Trigger event manually\nBreathe on sensor (CO₂ + humidity spike) Should trigger event report within 5-10 minutes Confirms sensor operational If still no data after 2 hours:\nSensor may need reprovisioning (rare) Contact support with sensor ID and issue description Support and Diagnostics Collecting Diagnostic Information When contacting support, provide:\nSensor Information:\nSensor ID (from QR code label) Installation date Physical location description Battery installation/replacement dates Symptom Details:\nWhat is not working as expected? When did issue start? Any recent changes (new batteries, moved sensor, configuration changes)? How frequently does issue occur?

sensors\n","excerpt":"Common issues, diagnostic procedures, and solutions for Thingsee AIR …","ref":"/devices/sensors/thingsee-air/troubleshooting/","tags":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"body":"Quick Diagnostics Sensor Health Checklist Before detailed troubleshooting, verify these basics:\n✅ Power:\nUSB cable connected to sensor cradle USB power adapter plugged into active outlet Outlet not controlled by light switch (check switch positions) Power adapter LED lit (if equipped with indicator) ✅ Installation:\nSensor securely attached to cradle (springs facing upward, snap sound heard) Cradle firmly mounted (tape adhesion good, or screws tight) ToF sensor lens clean (no dust, dirt, or condensation) Passageway width ≤ 1000mm Sensor centered above passageway ✅ Network:\nGateway operational (check IoT Studio) Sensor “Last seen” in IoT Studio \u003c 10 minutes Signal strength (RSSI) \u003e -85 dBm ✅ Configuration:\nDirection configured via Toolbox app (IN or OUT selected) “Configuration successful” message received Entry/exit counts verified with walkthrough test Detection Issues No Counts Recorded Symptom: Sensor shows zero entries and exits despite people walking through.\nPossible Cause 1: Power Lost, Counter Reset Diagnosis:\nCheck “Last seen” timestamp in IoT Studio (if old, power may have been lost recently) Verify USB cable connected to sensor cradle Verify outlet active (test with phone charger or lamp) Solution:\nReconnect power: Ensure USB cable fully inserted into sensor cradle Check outlet: Verify outlet not controlled by light switch (flip all switches nearby) Test outlet: Plug phone charger into outlet, verify it works Restart sensor: Disconnect and reconnect USB power (counter resets, but sensor should come back online) Monitor IoT Studio: Wait 5-10 minutes, check “Last seen” updates Prevention:\nUse dedicated outlet (not on switchable circuit) Label outlet “DO NOT TURN OFF - Sensor Power” Consider UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for critical applications Possible Cause 2: Network Connectivity Issue Diagnosis:\n“Last seen” timestamp old (\u003e 10 minutes) No data appearing in IoT Studio despite power connected RSSI weak or missing Solution:\nCheck gateway status: Verify gateway online in IoT Studio (Devices → Gateways) Check RSSI: If \u003c -95 dBm, signal too weak Move sensor closer to gateway (within ~20m direct, ~10m through walls) Add Wirepas routers/repeaters to extend mesh coverage Restart sensor: Disconnect and reconnect USB power (forces network rejoin) Wait for network join: Allow 5-10 minutes for sensor to rejoin Wirepas mesh Verify in IoT Studio: Check “Last seen” updates Prevention:\nVerify RSSI \u003e -85 dBm during installation Document sensor-to-gateway distance in installation records Add mesh routers proactively in large buildings Possible Cause 3: Direction Not Configured Diagnosis:\nNo entry/exit counts despite people walking through No configuration performed via Toolbox app during installation Solution:\nOpen Thingsee Toolbox app on smartphone/tablet Scan QR code on sensor Select direction: IN (if sensor inside room) or OUT (if sensor outside room/in corridor) Confirm configuration: Verify “Configuration successful” message Test: Walk through doorway, wait 5 minutes, check IoT Studio for counts Possible Cause 4: ToF Sensor Lens Obscured Diagnosis:\nLens dirty (dust, fingerprints, condensation) Physical obstruction (sticker, label, spider web) Solution:\nInspect lens: Look at sensor “eyeball” (ToF lens on bottom of sensor unit) Clean lens: Wipe gently with dry, lint-free cloth (microfiber cloth ideal) Remove obstructions: Remove any stickers, labels, tape covering lens Test: Walk through doorway, verify counts appear Prevention:\nClean lens quarterly (or monthly in dusty environments) Avoid touching lens during installation Inspect lens during routine maintenance Undercounting (Fewer Counts Than Expected) Symptom: Sensor detects some people but misses many entries/exits.\nPossible Cause 1: Passageway Too Wide Diagnosis:\nPassageway width \u003e 1000mm Sensor off-center (not equidistant from sides) Solution:\nMeasure passageway width: Verify ≤ 1000mm If \u003e 1000mm: Install second sensor to cover additional width Or consider Haltian ENTRYWAY sensor (max 1600mm width, battery-powered) Center sensor: Ensure sensor centered above passageway (equal distance from sides) Test: Walk through at different lateral positions (left, center, right), verify all detected Prevention:\nMeasure passageway width before ordering sensor Choose Haltian ENTRYWAY for passageways 1000-1600mm Document passageway dimensions in installation plan Possible Cause 2: Lighting Interference Diagnosis:\nBright sunlight on sensor (direct sun through window) Incandescent, fluorescent, or halogen lamps near sensor Counts lower during daytime (sunlight) than night (no sun) Solution:\nIdentify light sources: Look for windows with direct sunlight on sensor Identify incandescent/fluorescent/halogen lamps within 3-5 meters of sensor Mitigate sunlight: Install window shades or blinds (close during bright sun) Relocate sensor to avoid direct sun (if possible) Change lighting: Replace incandescent/fluorescent/halogen lamps with LED lights (ToF-compatible) Test: Walk through doorway at different times of day, verify counts consistent Prevention:\nAvoid sensor locations with direct sunlight during site survey Use LED lighting in sensor areas (ToF-compatible) Document lighting conditions in installation records Possible Cause 3: Installation Height Incorrect Diagnosis:\nSensor installed too high (\u003e 250cm from floor) Sensor installed too low (\u003c 200cm from floor) Solution:\nMeasure installation height: Distance from floor to sensor Optimal height: 230cm from floor (adjustable based on ceiling height) If too high or too low: Relocate sensor to 230cm ± 20cm Test: Walk through doorway, verify counts accurate Prevention:\nMeasure and mark installation height before mounting (use tape measure) Document installation height in records Possible Cause 4: Very Slow Walking Speed Diagnosis:\nPeople walking very slowly through doorway (e.g., elderly, children) ToF sensor may not detect sufficient distance change Solution:\nTest with slow walking: Walk very slowly through doorway, observe counts If undercounting slow walkers: Contact Haltian support for sensitivity adjustment Consider alternative: If slow traffic common, discuss with support (may recommend different sensor or configuration) Overcounting (More Counts Than Expected) Symptom: Sensor counts more entries/exits than actual people passing through.\nPossible Cause 1: People Lingering Beneath Sensor Diagnosis:\nPeople stop directly beneath sensor (reading phone, talking) Person shifts position while beneath sensor (ToF interprets as multiple passages) Solution:\nObserve traffic: Monitor doorway for people stopping beneath sensor Signage: Post “Keep moving” sign if people frequently stop Relocate sensor: If space allows, move sensor slightly off-center (still within 1000mm coverage, but not directly above common stopping point) Accept tolerance: Some overcounting acceptable if \u003c10% of total traffic Possible Cause 2: Objects Moving Through Diagnosis:\nCarts, dollies, or large objects passing through doorway ToF detects distance change (interprets as person) Solution:\nIdentify objects: Observe traffic for non-person objects (carts, strollers, large packages) Filter in analytics: If downstream system allows, filter out very fast or very slow passages (carts typically faster or slower than people) Accept tolerance: Some overcounting from objects may be acceptable depending on application Possible Cause 3: Lighting Fluctuations Diagnosis:\nRapidly changing light (flashing signs, strobe effects, sun through moving tree branches) ToF sensor interprets light changes as distance changes Solution:\nIdentify light sources: Look for flashing lights, rapidly changing sun patterns Mitigate: Cover windows (blinds), remove/relocate flashing signs Test: Verify overcounting stops after mitigating light changes Reversed Entry/Exit Counts Symptom: Entries and exits swapped (entry shows in “exits”, exit shows in “entries”).\nPossible Cause: Incorrect Direction Configuration Diagnosis:\nDirection configured incorrectly during installation (IN selected when should be OUT, or vice versa) Solution:\nVerify sensor location: Is sensor inside room (should be IN) or outside room/in corridor (should be OUT)? Reconfigure direction: Open Thingsee Toolbox app Scan QR code on sensor Select correct direction: IN (if inside room) or OUT (if outside room) Confirm “Configuration successful” Test: Walk from corridor into room, verify “entries” increments (if IN configured) Document: Update installation records with correct direction Counter Reset Reconfiguring direction may reset entry/exit counters to zero. Document current counts before reconfiguring if historical data important.\nPower Issues Sensor Not Powering On Symptom: Sensor offline, no “Last seen” updates in IoT Studio.\nPossible Cause 1: USB Cable Not Connected Diagnosis:\nUSB cable disconnected from sensor cradle USB cable disconnected from power adapter Solution:\nCheck cradle connection: Verify USB cable fully inserted into sensor cradle (connector springs facing upward) Check power adapter: Verify USB cable connected to power adapter Check outlet: Verify power adapter plugged into outlet Restart: Disconnect and reconnect USB power at cradle Wait for network join: Allow 5-10 minutes, check “Last seen” in IoT Studio Possible Cause 2: Outlet Not Active Diagnosis:\nOutlet controlled by light switch (currently off) Circuit breaker tripped Outlet failed Solution:\nTest outlet: Plug phone charger or lamp into outlet, verify it works Check light switches: Flip all nearby switches (check if outlet becomes active) Check circuit breaker: Verify breaker for outlet not tripped (reset if needed) Try different outlet: If current outlet failed, use nearby outlet (may require longer USB cable) Prevention:\nUse outlets on dedicated circuits (not controlled by switches) Label outlet “DO NOT TURN OFF - Sensor Power” Document outlet circuit breaker number in installation records Possible Cause 3: Power Adapter or Cable Failed Diagnosis:\nPower adapter LED not lit (if equipped with indicator) USB cable damaged (frayed, cut) Solution:\nTest power adapter: Plug into different outlet, check LED lit Test cable: Use multimeter to check continuity (or replace with known-good USB cable) Replace: Order replacement power adapter or USB cable from Haltian Contact support@haltian.com for replacement parts Intermittent Power Loss Symptom: Counter resets periodically, “Last seen” gaps in IoT Studio.\nPossible Cause 1: Loose Connection Diagnosis:\nUSB cable not fully inserted into cradle (vibration or movement causes disconnect) USB cable not fully inserted into power adapter Solution:\nReseat connections: Disconnect and firmly reconnect USB cable at both ends (cradle and power adapter) Verify snap: Ensure USB connector in cradle makes audible snap (springs engage) Secure cable: Use cable clamp on cradle to prevent strain on USB connector Test: Monitor “Last seen” in IoT Studio for 24 hours, verify no gaps Possible Cause 2: Unstable Outlet Power Diagnosis:\nOutlet on overloaded circuit (voltage drops when high-power device starts) Outlet shared with noisy devices (motors, compressors) Solution:\nIdentify circuit load: Check what else on same circuit (HVAC, refrigerators, large machines) Move to dedicated outlet: Use outlet on lightly loaded circuit UPS: Install UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to buffer voltage fluctuations Test: Monitor “Last seen” for 24 hours, verify stable Possible Cause 3: Cable Damage Diagnosis:\nUSB cable pinched (by door, furniture) Cable frayed from repeated bending Solution:\nInspect cable: Look for visible damage (cuts, fraying, pinch marks) Reroute cable: Avoid pinch points (door hinges, moving furniture) Replace cable: Order replacement USB cable (contact Haltian support) Network Connectivity Issues Sensor Not Joining Network Symptom: Sensor powered on but never appears in IoT Studio, or “Last seen” never updates.\nPossible Cause 1: Gateway Offline Diagnosis:\nGateway not powered on or network cable disconnected Gateway offline in IoT Studio Solution:\nCheck gateway status: IoT Studio → Devices → Gateways → Find gateway, verify online Restart gateway: Power cycle gateway (disconnect power, wait 30 seconds, reconnect) Verify network: Ensure gateway connected to internet (Ethernet cable secure, router operational) Wait for sensor rejoin: After gateway online, wait 10-15 minutes for sensor to join Possible Cause 2: Out of Range Diagnosis:\nSensor too far from gateway (\u003e 20m direct line, \u003e 10m through walls) No Wirepas routers between sensor and gateway Solution:\nMeasure distance: Estimate distance from sensor to gateway If \u003e 20m: Add Wirepas routers/repeaters to extend mesh Or relocate sensor closer to gateway Or add additional gateway Test: Move sensor temporarily closer to gateway (within 5-10m), verify it joins network If joins when close, range is issue → Add routers Possible Cause 3: Sensor Provisioning Issue Diagnosis:\nSensor not provisioned to correct Wirepas network Sensor credentials incorrect Solution:\nContact Haltian support: Provide device ID (from QR code) Verify provisioning: Support checks if sensor provisioned to correct network Re-provision if needed: Support may need to re-provision sensor Restart sensor: Power cycle after re-provisioning Weak Signal Strength (Low RSSI) Symptom: RSSI \u003c -85 dBm, intermittent connectivity, data gaps.\nPossible Cause 1: Distance from Gateway Diagnosis:\nSensor far from gateway (15-20m or more) RSSI -85 to -95 dBm (marginal signal) Solution:\nCheck RSSI in IoT Studio: Devices → Find sensor → Signal strength Add routers: Install Wirepas routers between sensor and gateway Each router extends range by ~20m Relocate gateway: Move gateway closer to sensor (if feasible) Test: After adding routers, verify RSSI improves to \u003e -85 dBm Possible Cause 2: Physical Obstructions Diagnosis:\nMetal walls, thick concrete, or elevator shafts between sensor and gateway RSSI lower than expected for distance Solution:\nIdentify obstructions: Map building layout (metal walls, concrete, elevators) Add routers: Place routers to create path around obstructions Relocate sensor or gateway: Avoid direct line through obstructions (if possible) Data Gaps in IoT Studio Symptom: Sensor online but periodic gaps in entry/exit data (no reports for hours, then resumes).\nPossible Cause 1: Intermittent Power Loss Diagnosis:\nCounter resets periodically (indicates power lost) “Last seen” gaps correlate with counter resets Solution:\nSee “Intermittent Power Loss” section above (loose connection, unstable outlet) Possible Cause 2: Network Congestion Diagnosis:\nMany sensors on same mesh network (\u003e 50-100 devices) Data gaps during peak traffic times (e.g., business hours) Solution:\nContact Haltian support: Report data gaps with device ID and timestamps Network analysis: Support analyzes mesh congestion Add gateways: Deploy additional gateways to segment mesh and reduce congestion Adjust reporting intervals: Reduce reporting frequency (longer intervals) to lower network traffic Configuration Issues QR Code Scanning Problems Symptom: Thingsee Toolbox app cannot read QR code on sensor.\nPossible Cause 1: QR Code Obscured or Damaged Diagnosis:\nQR code sticker dirty (dust, fingerprints) QR code sticker damaged (scratched, faded, peeling) Solution:\nClean QR code: Wipe gently with dry cloth Improve lighting: Use flashlight to illuminate QR code (avoid glare) Hold steady: Keep smartphone still while scanning (autofocus needs time) Try different angle: Avoid reflections or shadows on QR code If sticker damaged: Contact Haltian support for device ID (can configure without QR code) Possible Cause 2: Camera Focus Issues Diagnosis:\nSmartphone camera not focusing on QR code Smartphone camera lens dirty Solution:\nClean camera lens: Wipe smartphone camera lens with cloth Tap to focus: Tap QR code on screen to force autofocus Adjust distance: Move smartphone closer or farther from QR code (15-30cm optimal) Configuration Not Applied Symptom: Toolbox app shows “Configuration successful” but entry/exit counts still reversed.\nPossible Cause 1: Configuration Timeout Diagnosis:\nConfiguration sent but sensor did not receive (Bluetooth interference) Sensor rebooted before applying configuration Solution:\nReconfigure: Scan QR code again with Toolbox app Move closer: Stand within 1-2 meters of sensor during configuration (improve Bluetooth signal) Verify confirmation: Ensure “Configuration successful” message appears Test: Wait 5 minutes, walk through doorway, check counts in IoT Studio Possible Cause 2: Wrong Direction Selected Diagnosis:\nSelected IN when should be OUT (or vice versa) Counts still reversed after configuration Solution:\nVerify sensor location: Confirm sensor inside room (IN) or outside room (OUT) Reconfigure: Scan QR code, select opposite direction from previous attempt Test: Walk through doorway, verify “entries” increments correctly Bluetooth Connection Issues Symptom: Toolbox app cannot connect to sensor after scanning QR code.\nPossible Cause 1: Bluetooth Disabled Diagnosis:\nSmartphone Bluetooth turned off Bluetooth permission denied to Toolbox app Solution:\nEnable Bluetooth: Settings → Bluetooth → Turn on Grant permission: Settings → Apps → Thingsee Toolbox → Permissions → Enable Bluetooth Restart app: Close and reopen Toolbox app Retry: Scan QR code again Possible Cause 2: Out of Bluetooth Range Diagnosis:\nToo far from sensor (\u003e 2-3 meters) Obstacles between smartphone and sensor Solution:\nMove closer: Stand within 1-2 meters of sensor Remove obstacles: Metal objects may block Bluetooth (move aside if present) Retry: Scan QR code again Data and Analytics Issues Counts Not Matching Expectations Symptom: Entry/exit counts significantly different from manual observations or expectations.\nDiagnosis Process Manual count test: Have observer manually count people for 1 hour, compare to sensor data Identify discrepancy type: Undercounting: Sensor counts \u003c manual count (see “Undercounting” section above) Overcounting: Sensor counts \u003e manual count (see “Overcounting” section above) Reversed: Entries/exits swapped (see “Reversed Entry/Exit Counts” section above) Check environmental factors: Lighting, passageway width, installation height Contact support: If discrepancy \u003e 10-15%, contact support@haltian.com with: Device ID Manual count vs. sensor count (with time period) Installation details (passageway width, height, lighting) Photos of installation (helpful for diagnosis) Missing Data in IoT Studio Symptom: No entry/exit data appearing in IoT Studio despite sensor online.\nPossible Cause 1: Reporting Interval Too Long Diagnosis:\nReporting interval configured to very long period (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours) Or trigger-based reporting (e.g., report every 100 entries) not yet reached threshold Solution:\nWait: If very low traffic, sensor may not have reached reporting threshold yet Contact support: Request shorter reporting interval (e.g., every 30 seconds to 5 minutes) Test: Walk through doorway multiple times to trigger threshold (if trigger-based) Possible Cause 2: Data Export or API Issue Diagnosis:\nData in IoT Studio but not appearing in third-party dashboard or analytics platform API integration not configured correctly Solution:\nVerify data in IoT Studio: Confirm entry/exit data visible in Haltian IoT Studio (raw data) Check API integration: Verify API credentials, endpoint URLs correct Test API: Use Postman or curl to test API endpoint, verify data returned Contact support: If API not working, contact support@haltian.com for integration assistance Physical Installation Issues Sensor Falling Off (Tape Installation) Symptom: Sensor sagging or fell off mounting surface.\nPossible Cause 1: Surface Not Clean Diagnosis:\nDust, grease, or moisture on mounting surface before tape installation Tape adhesion failed within days or weeks Solution:\nRemove sensor: Carefully detach sensor and cradle Clean surface: Wipe mounting surface with IPA (isopropyl alcohol) solvent Allow 30 seconds to evaporate (surface completely dry) Replace attachment plate: Use new attachment plate with fresh adhesive tape Apply firmly: Press attachment plate firmly onto surface for 5 seconds Wait 24 hours: Allow tape adhesive to cure fully before attaching sensor cradle Test: Gently tug on cradle to verify secure attachment Prevention:\nAlways clean surface with IPA before tape installation Choose smooth, non-porous surfaces (painted drywall, smooth wood, glass, metal) Avoid textured surfaces (rough concrete, popcorn ceilings) Possible Cause 2: Heavy Load or Vibration Diagnosis:\nUSB cable pulling on sensor (strain on tape) Vibrations from HVAC, doors slamming (loosens tape over time) Solution:\nUse screw installation instead: Permanent screw installation more secure for high-vibration areas Reduce cable strain: Use cable clamp on cradle, route cable to reduce pull on sensor Add support: If tape installation preferred, add small screw beneath cradle as backup support Sensor Misaligned Symptom: Counts lower than expected, sensor visibly off-center above passageway.\nDiagnosis Sensor not centered (closer to one side of passageway) People on far side of passageway not detected Solution:\nMeasure passageway: Verify ≤ 1000mm width Mark center: Measure and mark exact center of passageway on ceiling/mounting surface Reposition sensor: If tape installation, remove and reinstall at center mark If screw installation, unscrew and reinstall at center Test: Walk through at different lateral positions (left, center, right), verify all detected Advanced Troubleshooting Sensor Firmware Update Symptom: Haltian support recommends firmware update to fix known issue.\nProcess:\nContact support: support@haltian.com provides firmware file and instructions Download firmware: Save firmware file to computer Update via IoT Studio or support portal: Follow support instructions (varies by firmware version) Verify update: Check firmware version in IoT Studio after update Test: Verify issue resolved after update Factory Reset Symptom: Sensor not responding to configuration, persistent issues.\nWarning: Factory reset erases all settings (entry/exit counters reset to zero, direction configuration lost).\nProcess:\nContact Haltian support: Request factory reset instructions (method varies by sensor version) Perform reset: Follow support instructions (typically involves power cycling with specific timing) Reconfigure: After reset, reconfigure direction via Thingsee Toolbox app Verify network join: Wait 10 minutes, check “Last seen” in IoT Studio Sensor Replacement Symptom: Hardware failure, sensor not working despite all troubleshooting.\nWarranty claim process:\nContact

Contact support for sensor verification.\nHumidity Readings Seem Wrong Symptoms:\nHumidity significantly different from other devices Values seem too high or too low Possible Causes:\nConsumer comparison device inaccurate (±5-10% typical) Sensor in microclimate (near bathroom, kitchen, humidifier) Recent battery change (sensor needs recalibration time) Sensor exposed to condensing humidity Solutions:\nVerify comparison device accuracy\nConsumer humidity meters often inaccurate Thingsee ENVIRONMENT: ±5% RH accuracy Use NIST-traceable reference if available Check sensor location\nNot near bathroom or kitchen (high humidity) Not near humidifier or dehumidifier Not in direct HVAC airflow Relocate if in microclimate Wait for stabilization\nAfter battery change, wait 1-2 hours After exposure to condensing humidity, wait 4-6 hours for sensor recovery Verify no condensation exposure\nHumidity sensor degrades if exposed to condensing conditions IP30 rating: Not suitable for wet environments If condensation occurred, contact support for sensor evaluation Ambient Light Readings Fluctuate or Seem Incorrect Symptoms:\nLight values don’t match expectations Readings fluctuate wildly Doesn’t detect lights on/off Important: Light sensor is not calibrated - provides indicative values only\nPossible Causes:\nSensor orientation (not facing light sources) Shadows or obstructions blocking sensor Daylight overwhelming artificial light Normal behavior (sensor designed for on/off detection, not precision) Solutions:\nUnderstand sensor limitations\nLight measurement indicative only Suitable for relative changes and on/off detection Not suitable for precision lux measurements Check sensor orientation\nSensor face should point toward room lights Not obstructed by furniture or equipment Not in shadow Verify light source detection\nTurn lights fully on → expect 300-1000+ lux Turn lights fully off → expect \u003c 50 lux Large difference confirms working Consider daylight interference\nNear windows: daylight may overwhelm room lights Use higher threshold (e.g., 10,000 lux) to detect major changes Or relocate sensor away from window influence Expected behavior: Large changes (thousands of lux) when lights turn on/off. Absolute values less important than relative changes.\nMagnetic Switch Not Detecting Door/Window Opens Symptoms:\nState counter not incrementing Door opens but no detection in IoT Studio Inconsistent detection Possible Causes:\nMagnet and sensor not aligned Gap too large (\u003e 15mm) Wrong magnet type (too weak) Magnet orientation incorrect Solutions:\nVerify alignment\nSensor and magnet must be parallel, facing each other Maximum gap when closed: 15mm (preferably 5-10mm) Use ruler to measure gap Check magnet strength\nUse strong permanent magnet (neodymium recommended) Test: Magnet should attract small metal objects Weak magnets may not trigger sensor Test magnet orientation\nMagnet has north and south poles Try flipping magnet 180° if detection poor One orientation typically works better Verify sensor sees magnet\nWith door/window closed, magnet should be directly adjacent to sensor Move magnet closer if gap too large Check that door/window doesn’t sag or shift when opening/closing Test detection\nSlowly open door/window while watching IoT Studio Counter should increment within 1-5 minutes Perform several open/close cycles to confirm consistent detection If still not working: Magnet may be too weak, or gap too large. Contact support for replacement magnet or troubleshooting assistance.\nMachine Usage Mode Not Detecting Vibration Symptoms:\nEquipment running but no vibration reports Machine Usage Mode enabled but no data Accelerometer shows static values only Possible Causes:\nMachine Usage Mode not actually enabled (contact support required) Insufficient vibration (below 128mG threshold) Poor mechanical coupling (tape mounting on vibrating equipment) Equipment not actually running during test Solutions:\nVerify Machine Usage Mode enabled\nContact Haltian support to confirm configuration Standard mode does NOT detect vibration (only position/orientation) Support must remotely enable Machine Usage Mode Check mounting method\nMust use screw mounting for vibration detection Tape mounting insufficient (dampens vibration) Ensure rigid mechanical coupling to equipment Verify screws tight (no wobbling) Verify equipment vibration level\nSome equipment has very low vibration (\u003c 128mG threshold) Test by touching equipment - should feel vibration clearly If barely perceptible, may be below detection threshold Contact support to lower threshold if needed Confirm equipment actually running\nVerify equipment in operating mode (not idle) Run full operational cycle during test Check that vibration present at sensor location Check sensor orientation and location\nVibration strongest at certain points on equipment Try different mounting location if possible Ensure sensor not on dampened/isolated part If still not detecting: Contact support with equipment type, mounting details, and approximate vibration level. Support can verify Machine Usage Mode configuration and adjust sensitivity.\nBattery Issues Battery Life Shorter Than Expected Symptoms:\nBattery level dropping faster than 5-year expected life Frequent low battery warnings Battery depleted in \u003c 3 years Possible Causes:\nHigh reporting frequency (custom configuration) Machine Usage Mode (expected 4 years vs. 5 years standard) Poor signal strength (many retransmissions) Sensor acting as mesh router for many others Low-quality or old batteries Cold operating environment Solutions:\nReview configuration\nCheck reporting thresholds and intervals in IoT Studio Very low thresholds = frequent reports = more battery use Machine Usage Mode uses more power (50Hz sampling when active) Default thresholds optimal for battery life Improve signal strength\nPoor RSSI (\u003c -85 dBm) causes retransmissions Add intermediate sensors to improve mesh Better signal = less power per transmission Check mesh network density\nIf sensor routing for many others, power consumption higher Contact support for network topology review Verify battery quality\nUse recommended: Varta Industrial Pro 1.5V AAA LR03 Avoid bargain or off-brand batteries Check expiration date Old batteries (\u003e 2 years in storage) have reduced capacity Operating temperature\nCold environments reduce battery capacity Alkaline batteries lose capacity below +10°C Shorter battery life expected in cold areas Battery life estimates:\nStandard mode (default): 5 years Machine Usage Mode: 4 years High-frequency custom config: 3-4 years Low Battery Warning but Batteries Recently Replaced Symptoms:\nLow battery alert shortly after new batteries Battery level drops rapidly from 100% Possible Causes:\nBatteries not fresh (old stock) Poor quality batteries Battery contacts not making good connection Very cold environment affecting measurement Solutions:\nVerify battery freshness\nCheck expiration date on battery packaging Batteries have ~2-3 year shelf life Old stock may have reduced capacity Test battery voltage\nUse multimeter: should read 1.5-1.6V per battery when fresh \u003c 1.4V indicates depleted or defective Try different battery brand\nUse recommended: Varta Industrial Pro AAA Alkaline batteries required (not lithium, not rechargeable) Clean battery contacts\nRemove batteries Clean contacts with isopropyl alcohol Ensure spring contacts not damaged Reinsert fresh batteries Check environmental temperature\nBattery level calculation affected by extreme cold Below +10°C, apparent capacity reduces If sensor in cold zone, indication may be pessimistic Wait 24 hours\nBattery level calculation may need time to stabilize If drops to \u003c 20% within 24 hours, batteries defective If issue persists: Try completely different battery batch. Contact support with sensor ID and battery details.\nNetwork and Connectivity Issues Sensor Reporting Intermittently Symptoms:\nGaps in data (missing hours or days) “Last Seen” timestamp irregular Messages arrive in bursts, then silence Possible Causes:\nBorderline signal strength (RSSI near -85 dBm) Gateway intermittent connectivity or reboots Temporary RF interference Mesh network instability Solutions:\nCheck signal strength trends\nReview RSSI history in IoT Studio If hovering around -85 dBm, borderline coverage Add intermediate sensor to improve link Verify gateway stability\nCheck gateway uptime and connectivity Gateway reboots cause temporary sensor silence Review gateway logs for issues Monitor for patterns\nDo gaps occur at specific times?
