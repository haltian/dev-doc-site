  PIR-based presence detection sensor for occupancy monitoring and visitor counting
---

## Overview

Thingsee PRESENCE is a wireless sensor for measuring people presence throughout your facility. The sensor uses passive infrared (PIR) technology to detect heat source movement (human, animal, etc.) in an area and reports the indicative count of detections to the cloud.

The device supports two distinct operating modes:
- **Visitor Counting Mode** - Counts movements for traffic analysis
- **Occupancy Mode** - Detects workspace or area occupancy status

Thingsee PRESENCE connects via Wirepas Mesh network and requires a Wirepas-enabled gateway for cloud communication.

### Before Installation

1. **Ensure gateway is operational** - Verify Wirepas gateway is installed and connected (LED blinking green)
2. **Identify the sensor** - Scan QR code with Thingsee Toolbox app or QR reader
3. **Plan sensor placement** - Review detection area charts for your installation height
4. **Select appropriate dome** - Choose Visitor Counter or Occupancy dome if needed

### Installation Steps

1. **Remove battery tab**
   - Carefully pull out the battery security tab
   - LED indicator (red) will flash once
   - If no LED flash within 2 minutes, tap sensor against palm
   - If no events within 5 minutes, re-install batteries

2. **Clean surface**
   - Clean attachment surface with IPA solvent (isopropyl alcohol)
   - Ensure surface is dry before mounting

3. **Attach sensor**
   - Remove tape's paper cover from sensor backside
   - Push sensor firmly against surface for minimum 5 seconds
   - Wipe sensor with dry, clean cloth

### Visitor Counting Installation

**Ceiling Installation:**
- Place sensor in middle of door opening
- Position 5-10 cm from wall
- Ensure no obstacles between sensor and detection area

**Door Opening Installation:**
- Install at top middle of door opening
- Orient sensor according to movement direction
- Ensure clear line of sight to floor

**Using Visitor Counter Dome:**
- Dome narrows detection beam for accuracy
- Detection area is narrowed relative to sensor's long side
- Can be attached with screws for secure installation
- Attachment clips alone sufficient for most installations

**Detection Area Shape:**
Detection area dimensions vary by installation height. See detection capability chart below.

![Detection capability vs height](/assets/images/haltian-iot/devices/1024-471.png)

### Workspace Occupancy Installation

**Under-Table Installation:**
- Install sensor under table as centered as possible
- If table legs present, place sensor on user side of leg
- Maintain 50mm gap between sensor and objects for maintenance access
- Decrease sensitivity to avoid detections outside workspace

**Using Occupancy Dome:**
- Dome adjusts detection beam for under-desk use
- Orient dome hole facing front for best accuracy
- Can be attached with screws if needed
- Cut off screw attachment parts if using clips only (do not damage clips)

**Sensitivity Adjustment:**
Reduce sensitivity to focus detection on workspace area only. This prevents false triggers from people walking near the desk.

### Installation Guidelines

![Sensor detection capabilities](/assets/images/haltian-iot/devices/800-1024.png)

**Height-Dependent Detection Area:**

The sensor's detection capability changes based on installation height:
- **Cone-shaped detection zone** - Wider coverage at greater distances
- **Adjustable sensitivity** - White lines in chart show sensitivity level effects
- **Maximum 34 movements/minute** - Regardless of direction or distance

**Factors Affecting Accuracy:**

**PIR Technology Considerations:**
- Detects changes in heat sources (moving humans)
- Temperature difference between person and environment affects reliability
- Small temperature differences reduce reliability significantly

**Visitor Counting Accuracy Factors:**
- Width of doorway (wider = more simultaneous passages)
- People walking side-by-side
- Standing or slowly moving lines
- Cleaning and maintenance activities

### Things to Avoid

## Device Identifiers

### Thingsee IoT Platform
- **IMC (Internal Model Code)**: TSPR04
- **Product family**: TSPR (Thingsee PRESENCE)
- **Variant index**: 04

### Haltian IoT Platform
- **Device identifier**: TBD (reverse URL notation to be added in future documentation update)

## Operating Modes

The sensor supports two distinct operating modes configured via cloud API.

### Visitor Counter Mode (Default)

Reports indicative count of detected movements for traffic analysis.

**Characteristics:**
- **Measurement type** - Movement detection count
- **Active reporting** - Every 1 minute when movement observed
- **Idle reporting** - Every 1 hour if no movement detected
- **Maximum count** - 34 events per minute
- **Use cases** - Doorways, corridors, entrances

**Message Flow:**
1. Sensor detects movements during measurement interval
2. At report interval (1 minute with movement, 1 hour without), sends message
3. Cloud receives movement count for interval
4. Counter resets for next measurement period

**Accuracy Considerations:**
- People walking side-by-side may count as single detection
- Very slow movement may not trigger detection
- Multiple people in close proximity may undercount

### Occupancy Mode

Reports workspace or area occupancy status using event-based messaging.

**Characteristics:**
- **Measurement type** - Occupancy status (occupied/vacant)
- **Event reporting** - Every time status changes (occupied ↔ vacant)
- **Idle reporting** - Every 1 hour if no status change
- **Network efficiency** - Reduces Wirepas traffic compared to movement counting
- **Use cases** - Desk occupancy, meeting rooms, individual spaces

**Message Flow:**
1. Sensor detects movement → state changes to "occupied"
2. Occupied event sent immediately
3. No movement for threshold period → state changes to "vacant"
4. Vacant event sent immediately
5. Periodic status update every 1 hour regardless of state

**Advantages:**
- Lower network traffic (only on state changes)
- Reduced power consumption
- Clear binary status (occupied/vacant)
- Suitable for workspace management systems

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
**Data Latency:** There's always a delay from measurement to alerts. Measurement results are sent in predefined intervals (e.g., 1 minute) and time is needed for data to travel through the network and be processed in the cloud service. This sensor is not suitable for real-time applications requiring instant alerts.
